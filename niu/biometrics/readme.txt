Doc folder contains the last report I've turned into the CS deptarment once I've finished my project or what I was able to accomplish in the time alloted
  (ie.  thin and binarize the image)


mathlab:  is some plots that can be used with mathlab which i've used on some datapoints obtained from our project.  (now, given we could have used excel to do the same thing...but mathlab sounds far fancier and more expensive for that matter)

source:  source code as well as .tif files which were manipulated and extracted.
