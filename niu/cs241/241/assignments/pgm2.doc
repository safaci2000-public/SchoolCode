                  CS241 Int. C and C++
Assignment 2
worth: 100 pts.
due: Sept. 27, 2000
The purpose of this assignment is to categorize the integers from 1 to 2000 
according to the following:
  category                         description
 PRIMES           - a number that is divisible by itself and one only
 PSQRTS           - any number that has a perfect square root
                    (ex.9 is a perfect sq. rt. since 9=3*3)
 DIVBY13          - any number divisible by 13
 FIBON            - any fibonacci number in the sequence (a0=0, a1=1,a2=1)
                    where ai = ai-1 + ai-2;
 OTHER            - any number that does not fall into any other category
                    (exclude all even numbers)

 Your program must have the following requirements:
  1.) use only arrays of bits
       you must use the following header file:  
         #INCLUDE "/home/ferrddp/janorob/cs241/pgm/bool.h"
  2.) all arrays must be declared in main, no global variables 
  3.) create a separate function for each category 
  4.) provide only one generic print function for printing out all resultant
           values. This function can only access one array at a time. 
  5.) write any extra functions you deem necessary depending on the design
           of your program. 

 
The output must have the following format:
 category (max of 10 spaces)
each line can have a maximum of 10 numbers with a minumin of 3 spaces between
each number. All numbers (columns) must be aligned.
Each cateogry must be printed out individually
No category should print on more than one page, but more than one category
can be printed per page

 PRIMES       2      3      5      7     11     13     17     19     23     27
             29     31     37     41     43     47     53     59     61     67

submit your assignment to ~janorob/cs241/subpgm/pgm2/reci
                        where i = your recitation section
if you submit your assignment to any other directory, it will be discarded and
NOT graded.
       your files should be named "(your z number).pgm2.c" (source)   and
                                  "(your z number).pgm2.out" (output)
