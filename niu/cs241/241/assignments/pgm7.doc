Assignment: program 7 
due date: Nov. 8, 2000 by 10:00 P.M.
worth: 80 points (an easy assignment) 

For assignment 7 you will be creating a binary search tree. The tree will
consist of nodes of the following prototype:

 struct node
  {
   int val;
   struct node *lnodepntr;
   struct node *rnodepntr;
  };

A binary search tree is a sorted tree.  The criteria for the tree is the 
following:
   1. all values to the left of a node are less than the value of that node
   2. all values to the right of the node are greater than or equal to the
      value of that node.  
   3. the first input value is the root of the tree

The input to your program will come from I/O redirection and each input will
be a series of integer values that are to be inserted into the tree. For 
example, 50 25 100 77 4 34 120 28 102 48 130 

At the end of your program write a print routine that will print the tree
out using a recursive inorder traversal.  This should print out the values
of the nodes in asending order.

When you are ready to submit your program, use the following path:
~janorob/cs241/subpgm/pgm7/reci  where i = your recitation session
be sure to use the correct naming convention
   z#.pgm7.c  (source c main pgm)
