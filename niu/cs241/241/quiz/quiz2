1.) What is the size(in bytes) of an int and a double on the unix system?

2.) What is the phase after compile, and what is the instruction 
    for that phase?

3.) What phase is responsible for resolving external references?

4.) What is the name of the file created by this command:
    gcc -c prog2.c
     a.) a.out
     b.) prog2.o
     c.) prog2.out
     d.) prog2

5.) How do you include a user defined file "myfile.h" in your program?
    Assume the file is in your directory

6.) How do you define a constant k=9.376?

7.) What is the difference between these two file names:
     file1 : aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacc
     file2 : aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabj

8.) Which code segment is more efficient and why?
  segment 1 = 
    int year;
    if(year % 4 == 0)
       {
        printf("Leap year");
       }

  segment 2 =
    int year, valresult;
    valresult = year % 4;
    if(!valresult)
      {
       printf("Leap year");
      }

9.) You have 2 files, main.c and fileg.c  They both contain source code
that is needs to be linked into an executable file.
 Write the commands to compile these:

 Write the command to link the 2 object files:

10.) You are using ftp in the directory:
       /home/mp/z971234/241/assign
     and you want to obtain the file document.doc from:
       /home/mp/z991234/
    Do this in one ftp command.  Assume you are already connected

11.) What ftp command will transfer a file from your computer onto mp?
     Give an example

12.) Which of the following contains an object table?
      a.) Source Code
      b.) Object Module
      c.) Executable file
      d.) None of the above

13.) Which of the following shows the correct precedence from highest to
     lowest?
      a.) + * / !
      b.) * ! + -
