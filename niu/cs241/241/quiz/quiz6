1.) How many bytes are allocated in memory for the following code? (3pts)
	struct node
         {
          int data;
          struct node *link;
         }

2.) Match the following (1pt each)
   Data Stucture		Used For
  --------------	     -----------------
   QUEUE			Expression Evaluation
   STACK			Memory Management
   TREE			        Operating System Scheduling

3.) What does the function malloc return? (3pts)
   

4.) Indicate whether the following is a dynamic or a static data stucture:
	(1 pt each)
  a.) 2D array
  b.) linked list
  c.) 1D array
  d.) sparce matrix

5.) List 2 advantages of a linked list. (1 pts each)


6.) Name the four data constructs.  (1 pt each)


7.) Write the code to dynamically allocate memory to the following node:
     struct node { 					(3pts)
         int key;
         struct node *nextptr;
       };


8.) Headptr currently points to the first node of a linked list which has
  the following format:
   struct node {
      char key;
      struct node * nextptr;
       };

   Write the code to set the first node's key variable to 'a'. Then link
  this node to another node pointed to by 'someptr'.  (4pts)
