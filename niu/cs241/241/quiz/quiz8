1.)  Write the 3 - letter designation for each of the corresponding tree
	traversal patterns: (1pt each)
 
        Inorder
        Preorder
        Postorder


2.) Create a binary search tree starting with the number 8.  The rest of
     the data for the tree will be 7, 18, 5, 10, 14, 11, 3, 8, 17 (3pts)
     a. 0
     b. 3
     c. 4
     d. 5
 


3.) Suppose T is a binary tree with 14 nodes.  What is the minimum
     possible depth of T? (2pts)


4.) What is the bounded or marked part of the following tree called in 
     relation to the tree? (2pts)

		A
	       / \
         -----/--|\
        |    B   | C
        |   / \  | 
        |  D   E |
        |        |
         --------


5.)  What are the features of Activation Records? (3pts)


6.) What are the main features of Recursion? (2pts)


7.) What do the 2 and 3 signify in a 2-3 Tree? (2pts)


8.) Write the C code to insert the node "New" into a double linked
    list at the beginning of the list.  Assume you have the value 
    "Headpntr" and the list contains more than 1 element. (3pts)
    (Hint 3 lines)
 

9.) Write the C code to delete the node pointed to by "Curr" from the
    end of a doubly linked list: Free the memory.  Assume you have a 
    "Tailpntr" (Hint 3 lines) (3pts)
