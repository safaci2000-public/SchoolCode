1.) In object - oriented programming with C++, functions belonging to a 
    class are called:__________ <2pts)

    
2.) How does a bubble-sort algorithm work(for ascending order) in one
     pass?(2pts)

    a.) low values migrate up to their proper position at the beginning of
	the array
    b.) high values migrate down to their proper position at the end 
        of the array
    c.) the lowest value is selected and swaped to the beginning of the 
        array
    d.) both a + b
    e.) bubblesort is recursive and sorting is done through 
        partitioning the array
