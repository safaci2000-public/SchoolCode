CSCI 241                ASSIGNMENT 1                   Summer 2001
                          POINTS
 
The NIU office wants to print a report containing a list of all
of students and their beginning of the semester status and their
end of semester status.  For each student processed there will be
two lines of data printed.  If the student's gpa has decreased by
the end of the semester the second output line will be flagged.
 
INPUT:
 
There are three types of records in this file.  The first field in
each type of record will be a code (integer).
The first type of record is the professor reference number record.
It has a code of 0 in the first positon. All reference records are
grouped together before the student records. Each reference record
has the following format:
==>reference# (int) teacher name(char array -maxlen of 10).
An example of this record would be:
0 562 janota

The second type of record is the student record. It has a code of 1.
in the first position. Each student record has the following format:
==>the social security number(long integer) of the student,
credits earned to date (integer), points earned to date (integer).
An example of this record would be:
1 123456789   25   100
 
The third type of record is the course reference record. It has a
code of 2 in the first position. Each course reference record has
the following format:
==>course reference number(integer), course credits(integer), and
letter grade earned(character).
An example of this record would be:
2   2563   4 B
 
Each student record will be followed by 0 or more course records
which represent the courses that the student took that semester. 
Update each student's original record with the new course
information by accumulating the points earned and the credits
earned. 
  
The input data is found in the file on the unix system: 
       ~janorob/cs241/pgm/pgm1.dat
IMPORTANT: Open the file in your program. DO NOT use I/O redirection.
Note: For each type of record (0-2), there is no restriction as
to the field boundaries. This means the spacing between fields
of each record type may vary.
 
OUTPUT:
 
The output report will be written to a file named Z??????1.out
where ?????? are the last 6 digits of your Z id number.
 
For each page, print report and column headings. The page heading
must contain the current part number being processed. 
For each student record print two lines.  The first line contains
the original student data which represents their status at the
beginning of the semester, including the social security number,
grade level, credits earned, points earned, current gpa.  The
second line will be printed after the courses for that semester
have been processed and the student's record has been updated and
will contain the same fields as the first line.  If the student's
gpa has decreased by the end of the semester print '^^^^^' at the
end of the line.
 
Print 10 students per page.  The two lines for each student
should be single spaced, but there should be a blank line between
students. After the 10th student, use the "\f" control char to
break to a new page.
 
The output will look similar to the following:
 
 
                  STUDENT STATUS REPORT                  PAGE:  1
 
SSN          GRADE LEVEL    CREDITS    POINTS    GPA     DECREASED
 
123456789    FRESHMAN         25         75      3.00
123456789    SOPHOMORE        35        115      3.29      
 
111111111    JUNIOR           65        240      3.69
111111111    JUNIOR           80        270      2.96      ^^^^^
 
 
After all students have been processed,  print a summary
containing the total number of students processed, and a break
down by class level of total students at that level, percent of
total students, and the number of students at that level who
improved their gpa's.  The summary must be on its own page and
contain a report heading.
 
An example of the final report summary follows.
 
 
                       STUDENT SUMMARY                   PAGE: 5
 
TOTAL STUDENTS:        40
 
                 TOTAL       PERCENT    IMPROVED
 
FRESHMAN:         10           25           5
SOPHOMORE:        10           25           4
JUNIOR:           10           25           1
SENIOR:           10           25           2
 
After all student summary reports have been created, print a
professor summary report that contains the professor's name, the
total number of students  and the average gpa for each professor.
The summary must be on its own page and contain a report heading
An example of this report summary follows:

                      PROFESSOR REPORT                   PAGE: 8

NAME          TOTAL STUDENTS              AVE. GPA
JANOTA            50                        3.88
WINANS            0                         0.00
ZERWEKH           55                        3.83
RANNIE            40                        2.56
 
NOTES:
 
1.  Write a function to assign points to letter grades.  It will
receive as input a character which represents a letter grade.  It
will return an integer representing the points for the grade.
Points should be assigned to letter grades as follows:  A = 4, B
= 3, C = 2, D = 1, F = 0.  (Use the switch statement in this
function.)
 
2.  Write a function which will, for each student processed, 
determine if the student lowered their GPA over the course of
the semester.  This function expects as input:  the initial gpa,
a pointer to a field to hold the new gpa and the fields needed to
calculate the new gpa.  This function will calculate the new gpa,
compare it with the initial gpa and then if the new gpa is lower
than the original gpa send back via a return statement a 0 if the
student did improve and a 1 if the student did not improve.  
 
3.  To update the appropriate grade level counter use the
following criteria:  0-30 credits = freshman; 31-60 credits =
sophomore; 61-90 credits = junior; 91 and up = senior.  (Note the
grade level counters are updated based upon the grade level at
the end of the semester, not the original grade level.)
 
4.  Write a function to print the report and column headings. 
This function expects as input pointer to the page number
variable.
 
5.  You may use other functions as you deem necessary.
 
6.  Print all gpa fields to two decimal places. 
 
7.  The output for this report, with the exception of the summary
lines, must be centered horizontally on the page.
 
8.  You must hand in printed copies of the source code contained
in the .c file and the output in the Z??????1.out. 
 
9.  Copy the .c and .out files into the electronic dropbox per
instructions discussed in class.  Name the source code file
Z??????1.c where ?????? is the last 6 digits of your Z9 number.
 
10.  Remember, this program must contain full documentation.
