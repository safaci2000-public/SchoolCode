Assignment 2
worth: 100 pts.
due: july 6, 2001
The purpose of this assignment is to categorize the integers from 1 to 3000 
according to the following:
  category                         description
 PRIMES           - a number that is divisible by itself and one only
 PSQRTS           - any number that has a perfect square root
                    (ex.9 is a perfect sq. rt. since 9=3*3)
 DIVBY13          - any number divisible by 13
 FACT             - any number defined by a factorial
                    where number = n * n-1 * n-2 * ..... * 2
                    so 120 = 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2
 FIBON            - a number defined by the fibonacci sequence. Any number
                    is determined by adding the two previous numbers in
                    the sequence (a0=0, a1=1,a2=1,a3=2,a4=3, etc.)
                    where a(i) = a(i-1) + a(i-2);
 OTHER            - any number that does not fall into any other category
                    (exclude all even numbers)

 Your program must have the following requirements:
  1.) use only arrays of bits. you must use the following header file:  
         #INCLUDE "/home/ferrddp/janorob/cs241/pgm/bool.h"
         use bitwise operators whenever possible
  2.) all arrays must be declared in main, no global variables 
  3.) create a separate function for each category 
  4.) provide only one generic print function for printing out all resultant
        values. This function can only access one array at a time. 
  5.) write any extra functions you deem necessary depending on the design
        of your program. 

There is NO input file. All values are to be generated internally by
your program.
The output must have the following format:
 category (max of 10 spaces)
each line can have a maximum of 10 numbers with a minumin of 3 spaces between
each number. All numbers (columns) must be aligned.
Each cateogry must be printed out individually
No category should print on more than one page, but more than one category
can be printed per page

As an example:
Category
 PRIMES       2      3      5      7     11     13     17     19     23     27
             29     31     37     41     43     47     53     59     61     67

  your files should be named "(your z number).pgm2.c" (source)   and
                             "(your z number).pgm2.out" (output)
