This is the only class I've unfortunately had to retake mostly due to an inadequate teacher.  The material covered wasn't difficult and I did get an A+ the second time around.

Hence the code in the 241 folder is flakey...but feel free to browse through it.
cs241b is the correct code...and I got 100% on everyone one of the programs I turned in in that summer semester.  

The only reason I include the code from my first semester to taking 241 is because I had far more assignments in the fall semester as opposed to the summer semester.

If nothing else, they might be of some use to some of our current NIU undergrads :D.
