CSCI 250                 Assignment 0                   Spring 2001
                          20 points


The text of a Cobol program is included with this assignment, along
with the job control language (JCL) needed to submit that program to
the IBM S/390 computer for execution.

Your task is to type this text, save it in a file, submit the file
for "execution", fetch the output to your screen to see if it is
correct, make any necessary changes to the file and resubmit it (as
often as needed until it is correct), and finally submit the file for
"execution AND print".  You will turn in the final printed copy.
(Note:  You may submit the file for "execution AND print" before it is
correct whenever you need a printed copy for debugging purposes).

Learning the things in the preceding paragraph is primarily a
do-it-yourself project, using the tutorial in the back of your COBOL
PROGRAMMING NOTES AND EXAMPLES book.

Sections 1 through 6 of CSCI 250 will begin the do-it-yourself process
during the second class period of the semester.  This class meeting
will be held in the CSL, PM 56, instead of the regular classroom.

Section 7 will go the CSL, PM 56, immediately AFTER the first class
period of the semester.  If that is not possible because of conflict
with another class, teaching assistants will be available to help you
get started on Thursday, January 18, from 2-6 p.m. in the FRL (Faraday
East 217).

TO WORK IN THE LAB, YOU WILL NEED
1.  a valid logonid (Z number)
2.  your password (originally set to the last 6 digits of your SSN)
3.  the information in your NOTES AND EXAMPLES book

If you ever need to have your password reset, dial 752-RSET.

If you have registered but do not have your logon id, you can get it
by telephone.  You will need your social security number and your
registration PIN. (If you have forgotten your registration PIN, call
815-753-0681.)  Here are the five steps to get your logon id:

     (1) Call 815-752-RSET (7738).
     (2) Select option one.
     (3) Enter social security number.
     (4) Enter registration PIN.
     (5) Select the logon id option.

If you are unable to complete your registration, you may obtain a
temporary logon id by calling 815-753-5897 between 8 a.m. and 4:30
p.m.  You must provide your name, social security number, and the
course reference number(s) for which you will be enrolling.  This
temporary account will be suspended after 30 days, so move all your
files to your regular account as soon as you get it.


A lot of information is available to help you use the system.
Academic Computing Services has put many documents on the web. Visit
www.niu.edu/acs/doc.html   Note especially "Using the Computer and
Communications Facilities."  Students who want to submit programs from
home should look at "Using the Student Computer and Communications
Facilities from a Remote Personal Computer."

Output from Assignment 0 will be the (unformatted) system date and
time in the upper left corner, plus data about one computer science
course, as follows:

082800 18302510

                    CSCI 250        Computer Programming in Cobol
                    Credit hours:   4
                    Prerequisites:  Math 110


If you do not get this output, either you made a typo or you typed
something in the wrong column. Both the JCL reader and the Cobol
compiler are very fussy about which columns things are typed in.  JCL
lines (beginning with a /) start in column 1.  Documentation lines
(beginning with a *) start in column 7.  IDENTIFICATION DIVISION
starts in column 8. SELECT... starts in column 12.  FD starts in
column 8 and is followed by 2 spaces, so that INPUT-FILE starts in
column 12.  Type the program exactly as given.  Do not try to improve
it in any way.

The program you turn in should have correct output, and both return
codes should be 0000.  The return codes are in the center of about
lines 6 and 7 of the JES2 Job Log (second printed page).  You should
see return codes of 0000 for both the .COB step and the .GO step.

When your program is working, submit it for "execution AND print" so
the output will go to the printer instead of the screen.  Then submit
it a SECOND TIME for "execution AND print" so that you will have a
printed backup copy.  You are expected to make a PRINTED backup copy
of every program during the entire semester.

When you are done with Assignment 0, DO NOT DELETE the file containing
the program.  You will modify it for Assignment 2.


JCL AND COBOL PROGRAM:

(Note to students:  You are expected to type the text of the Cobol
program below exactly as given, INCLUDING THE DOCUMENTATION.  In the
first two lines of the text, you must substitute your own Z number,
name, and bin number.  Use the last three digits of your Z number as
your bin number.)
