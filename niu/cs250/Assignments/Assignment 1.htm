               Structured Programming and Flowcharting
                           40 points


Draw structured flowcharts of the logic necessary for a computer to
solve each of the four problems below.  Use a pencil, a flowcharting
template, and white typing paper.  You may use legal-size paper if you
wish, or you may tape together a maximum of two 8 1/2 x 11 inch sheets.
Modularize your flowcharts (i.e., use subroutines) to reduce the length
of individual diagrams. If you want to continue on a second page without
taping the pages together, you may use an off-page connector only AT THE
BOTTOM OF ONE PAGE AND THE TOP OF THE NEXT PAGE.  In addition, page
breaks may not occur in the middle of a selection or iteration
structure.  We are very fussy about these rules.  The required technique
will be explained in class.  (If you prefer, you may use graphics
software instead of paper and pencil.  The same drawing rules apply.)

Label each solution with the information listed in the Course
Information handout.  FOLLOW THE FLOWCHARTING STANDARDS DISCUSSED IN
CLASS and demonstrated in the Notes and Examples book.  (Be aware that
your textbook uses some different conventions.)  Show in your flowcharts
the initializing and incrementing of all counters and accumulators.



(1) Read one record containing a customer name, the customer's old balance,
and a new charge.  Add the new charge to the old balance, and print out (on
one line) the customer's name and new balance.

(2) Read a file containing an unspecified number of student records.  Each 
record contains a student name, the number of credit hours completed so far,
and the number of honor points earned so far.  For each student, calculate the
GPA (honor points divided by credit hours).  Print the input data (name,
credit hours, and honor points) on one line, and print the GPA on the next
line.  At the end of the report, print the average GPA for all the students
(sum of all honor points divided by sum of all credit hours).  

(3) Read a file containing an unspecified number of records.  Each record
contains just one number.  Print the average of all the numbers read, the
highest number read, the lowest number read, and the count of how many times
the number 25 appeared in the data.

(4) Process a file of employee records to calculate a year-end bonus for each
employee. Each record in the file contain the employee-id, the employee's
annual salary, the number of years the employee has worked for the company,
and the employee's last performance rating.  If the performance rating is 3,
the bonus is 2% of the annual salary for employees of less than 5 years and 3% 
for employees of 5 years or more.  If the performance rating is 2, the bonus
is 3% for employees of less than 5 years and 4% for employees of 5 years or
more.  If the performance rating is 1, the bonus is 4% for employees of less
than 5 years and 5% for employees of 5 years or more.  Print each employee's
name and bonus amount.  At the end of the report, print the total amount of
bonuses to be paid.
