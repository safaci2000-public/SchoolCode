CSCI 250                     ASSIGNMENT 11                        Spring 2001
                        Multi-Dimensional Tables
                              (40 points)



This assignment requires writing a program to keep track of student quiz scores
across all sections of a multi-sectioned course.  There will be 4 sections, a
maximum of 15 students in each section, and 10 quizzes.  Each quiz has a maximum
score of 20 points.



INPUT:
------

There is one record in the input file for each student enrolled in the course,
but these records are not in any particular order.  Students from the various
sections are intermixed.

Each input record has the following format:

COLUMNS     CONTENTS                      FIELD TYPE

  1-7       Student ID                    Alphanumeric (a "Z" number)
    8       Unused
    9       Section number                Numeric (range 1-4)
   10       Unused
 11-30      Table of 10 quiz scores       Each quiz is numeric (2 digits)
 31-80      Unused



OUTPUT:
-------

     Print out a report similar to the sample output below.



PROCESSING NOTES:
-----------------

1)   Put all of the input data into a 3-dimensional table (section, student,
score).  Don't forget to initialize the table before you build it.

2)   You may use either indexes or subscripts.

3)   Round averages to the nearest integer.

4)   Although the table has room for 15 students in each section, some sections
may not be full.  Do not include the zeroes from the unused part of the table
when calculating the averages.

5)   Double space the detail lines.

6)   JCL for the input file:

     //GO.SYSIN  DD  DSN=T90ASS1.SPRING01.COBDATA(DATA11),DISP=SHR
