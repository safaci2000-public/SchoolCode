CSCI 250                       Assignment 2                     Spring 2001 
                  OPEN, CLOSE, STOP RUN, READ, WRITE, MOVE,
                       PERFORM procedure-name UNTIL
                               (40 points)
 
This assignment requires modification of Assignment 0, as follows:

(1) Instead of processing only one record, the program must process a file
containing an unspecified number of records.

(2) Instead of typing the data "in-stream", the data will be obtained from a
file.  

(3) The output format must be revised. 

 
INPUT:
 
The format of each input record is exactly the same as for Assignment 0, but
there is a whole file of records to be processed. To access the input:

(1) Remove the one line of in-stream data that follows //GO.SYSIN DD *

(2) Modify the //GO.SYSIN DD * statement so that it reads:

    //GO.SYSIN DD DSN=T90ASS1.SPRING01.COBDATA(DATA02),DISP=SHR
 
   
OUTPUT:                       
 
Print the unformatted system date and time as on Assignment 0.

Print the data from each input record in the format shown below:

                     CSCI 250, 4 credit hours
                     Computer Programming in Cobol
                     Prerequisites:  Math 110

Single space the three lines. Double space before each set of three lines. 
Center the data horizontally on the page (hint:  the 3rd line is potentially
the longest, so center that one, then position the others to align with it).

   
PROCESSING NOTES:
 
1.  Turn in (1) all of the output from your job (don't forget to keep a
printed backup copy), (2) a copy of the input data (obtained from running the
IEBPTPCH program on page 4 of the Notes and Examples book), and (3)
flowcharts.  Put your name on all three parts and clip them together.  Do not
staple the flowcharts to the program.  Write the information specified in the
Course Information handout on the front of the packet.
 
2.  When using the Print Punch Utility (IEBPTPCH) on page 4 of the
"Notes and Examples" book, you must replace the words 'data set name'
with 'T90ASS1.SPRING01.COBDATA(DATA02)' so that the whole line reads:

    //SYSUT1 DD DSN=T90ASS1.SPRING01.COBDATA(DATA02),DISP=SHR
  
3.  Don't forget to update the documentation to reflect the changes you made.
