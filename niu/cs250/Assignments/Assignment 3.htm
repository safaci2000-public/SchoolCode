CSCI 250                    Assignment 3                   Spring 2001
          Arithmetic, COMPUTE, ROUNDED, Page and Column Heads
                             40 points

Write a program to calculate and print some Fantasy Football statistics.

INPUT:
------
The input file contains one record for each quarter back. The records are
formatted as follows:

    COLUMNS       CONTENTS

       1-20       Player name             Alphanumeric
         21       Unused
      22-41       Team Name               Alphanumeric
         42       Unused
      43-45       Pass Attempts           Numeric, 3 digits
         46       Unused
      47-49       Pass Completions        Numeric, 3 digits
         50       Unused
      51-52       Touchdowns              Numeric, 2 digits
      53-80       Unused

OUTPUT:
-------
Sample output is provided as a separate document because the output is wide
and must be printed landscape in order to see all of the columns.
Instructions for printing landscape are on the web page. The totals shown
on the sample output are the actual totals your program should produce.

PROCESSING NOTES and REQUIREMENTS:
----------------------------------
(1)  Detail line calculations:

          Incomplete = Attempts - Completions

          Points = Touchdowns * 6

(2)  Summary line calculations:

          Total Attempts, Total Completions, Total Touchdowns, and Total
          Points are all accumulators (sums of their respective columns).

          % Completions = Total Completions / Total Attempts * 100

               The % completions must be rounded to the nearest integer.
               It also must be calculated TWICE.  The first calculation
               must use only arithmetic verbs (ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY,
               DIVIDE).  The second calculation must be done with a
               single COMPUTE verb.  The problems inherent in combining
               multiple operations in one compute statement will be
               discussed in class.

(3)  DO NOT use data names from print lines in arithmetic statements.  Do
     arithmetic in WORKING-STORAGE, and MOVE the numbers you want to print
     to the appropriate print line fields.

(4)  Print page and column heads at the top of your report. Don't forget
     the system data and time. You may assume that there will be only one
     page of data.  The totals will require another page header and
     another column header, but print the totals on the same page as the
     detail lines.

(5)  To run the Cobol program, use the Job Control Language (JCL) on page
     3 of Notes and Examples (same JCL you've used since Assignment 0),
     including the following line above the //GO.SYSOUT line:

          //GO.SYSIN DD DSN=T90ASS1.SPRING01.COBDATA(DATA03),DISP=SHR

(6)  Run the PRINT PUNCH UTILITY on page 4 of Notes and Examples to obtain
     a copy of the input data, and turn it in with your program.  The
     //SYSUT1 line should read:

     //SYSUT1 DD DSN=T90ASS1.SPRING01.COBDATA(DATA03),DISP=SHR

(7)  Document your program according to the documentation standards in
     Notes and Examples, and turn in a flowchart of your program logic.
