A furniture store needs a sales report.

Each input record represents one sale and is formatted as
follows:

     Columns 1-6     Customer number (2 letters plus 4 digits)
               7     Unused
             8-13    Date (mmddyy)
               14    Unused
            15-21    Amount of sale/return (dollars and cents)
               22    Unused
               23    Transaction type
                         1=sale
                         2=return
               24    Room type code
                         1=Dining room
                         2=Living room
                         3=Bedroom
                         4=Miscellaneous
            25-80    Unused

Use the following JCL to access the input data:

     //GO.SYSIN DD DSN=T90ASS1.SPRING01.COBDATA(DATA04),DISP=SHR


OUTPUT:

Format your output to look like the sample report provided
separately.


PROCESSING NOTES:

(1) Use floating dollar signs.

(2) Print returns as a negative number in the Amount column
(using the numeric edited symbol CR).  If the Running Total
becomes negative, show that with CR also.

(3) For the gross sales amounts, indicate negative numbers by a
minus sign after the dollar amount.

(4) Double space the detail lines. This will be a multi-page
report. Print 15 detail lines per page. Print page and column
heads at the top of each page.  The page headers must include the
page number.

(5) Print the gross sales on the last page of detail lines.

(6) Along with the program, turn in flowcharts plus a copy of the
input data (use the print punch utility program on page 4 of the
Notes and Examples book).
