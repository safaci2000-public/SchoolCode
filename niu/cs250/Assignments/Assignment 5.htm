CSCI 250                   ASSIGNMENT 5                     SPRING 2001
             Control Break Processing, INITIALIZE, SORT
                           (60 points)


You work for a large company that sells pet supplies (everything you need for
your cat or dog) by catalog.

You are to produce a sales report organized by Division (either Cat or Dog)
and within Division by Item Category.  The report must produce subtotals for
each item category as well as subtotals for each division.  At the end of the
report, grand totals must be printed.


INPUT:

For each product sold, the input file contains one record summarizing the
sales during the reporting period.  Also, for each product returned, the input
file contains one record summarizing the returns. Each record is formatted as
follows:

COLUMNS    CONTENTS

  1-5      Item identifier         Alphanumeric
    6      Unused
    7      Division                Alphanumeric
                                   C = cat
                                   D = dog
    8      Unused
  9-11     Item category           Alphanumeric
                                          BED = bedding/furniture
                                          GAT = gates and doors
                                          GRM = grooming
                                          TOY = toys
                                          TRV = travel
    12     Unused
 13-37     Item description        Alphanumeric
    38     Unused
 39-43     Item price              Numeric (dollars and cents)
    44     Unused
 45-47     Quantity                Numeric
    48     Unused
    49     Sold or Returned        Alphanumeric
                                          S = sold
                                          R = returned
 50-80     Unused


OUTPUT:

Format your report to look like the sample provided separately.  (Note: the
sample output is not to scale (some fields may need to be larger) and the
sample totals are not the actual ones that will be produced from the
input data.)  Check your output with a calculator to verify your totals.


PROCESSING NOTES:

1.  Follow the sample output for detail lines and subtotal lines.

2.  The input file is not sorted.  You will need to sort it by Division.
Within Division, sort it by Item Category.  Since you will be using all of the
records from the input file and will not be changing them in any way, the
USING/GIVING options are appropriate.  Refer to pages 414-419 for a sample
program.  The control break programs in Chapter 15 (1-level, 2-level, and
3-level) also make use of the USING and GIVING options.

3.  Define grand totals and subtotals in groups so the INITIALIZE verb
can be used to initialize them.  Do not use a VALUE clause or a MOVE
verb to set subtotals or grand totals to zero.

4.  Print page headers with page numbers at the top of each page. Assume that
two item categories will fit on one page along with any required subtotals.

5.  To get the dashed lines, consider VALUE ALL '-'.

6.  The SORT verb requires an extra FD (for the sorted file) as well as
an SD (to be used by SORT as a temporary work file).  You will need a
total of four SELECT statements.  Use the following ASSIGN clauses:

ASSIGN TO S-SYSIN            (use for the input file)
ASSIGN TO S-SORTWORK         (use for the SD)
ASSIGN TO S-SORTED           (use for the sorted file)
ASSIGN TO S-SYSOUT           (use for the output print file)

7.  Place the following lines of JCL after the /* line:

//GO.SYSIN  DD  DSN=T90ASS1.SPRING01.COBDATA(DATA05),DISP=SHR
//GO.SORTWORK DD DSN=&&SORTWORK,UNIT=DISK,VOL=SER=ACA302,
//          SPACE=(TRK,(1,1)),DISP=(NEW,PASS)
//GO.SORTED DD DSN=&&SORTED,UNIT=DISK,VOL=SER=ACA302,
//          SPACE=(TRK,(1,1)),DISP=(NEW,PASS)
//GO.SYSOUT DD SYSOUT=*

8.  You are no longer required to turn in the print punch, but you should
continue to get it so you can verify your output.  Flowcharts are required.
