ABC Properties, Inc., owns four apartment buildings and uses a sequential
master file to keep all of the necessary data on each apartment.

A sequential master file is updated periodically from a file of transaction
records.  The purpose of a data validation program is to examine each record
in the transaction file to determine whether it is valid or invalid.  Valid
transactions are used later as input to another program, the master file
update program.  (Assignment 10 will be an update program.)  Invalid
transactions are listed on an exception report, so that someone can correct
and resubmit them.

A data validation program is sometimes called an "edit" program or an "input
edit" program, but it does not change any data.  It just determines whether or
not input is valid.


INPUT
-----

Input to the data validation program is the raw (unedited) transaction file,
which may contain typos or other errors.  The transaction file has a date
record at the beginning, followed by any number of add, alter, and delete
transactions.  The record formats are shown below.

DATE RECORD:            COLUMNS    CONTENTS
                          1-5      Blanks
                          6-13     Date the transaction file was
                                      created.  Format:  MMDDYYYY
                         14-95     Blanks

TRANSACTION RECORDS:    COLUMNS    CONTENTS
                          1-4      Apartment ID (key field)
                           5       Transaction code (1=add, 2=alter,
                                      3=delete)

                    The format of the rest of the record depends on the
                    transaction code.


ADD Transaction:

An add transaction record contains all of the data needed to add a new record
to the master file:
                        COLUMNS    CONTENTS

                          6-7      Apartment or townhouse indicator
                            8      Number or bedrooms
                          9-12     Total square feet
                         13-20     Lease start date
                         21-28     Lease end date
                         29-88     Renter name(s)--from 1 to 4
                         89-90     Number of occupants
                                      89 -- Number of adults
                                      90 -- Number of children
                            91     Pets
                         92-95     Monthly rent

ALTER Transaction:

There are nine types of alter transaction records, each of which will be used
ultimately to alter a different field in a master file record.  The alter type
is specified in columns 6 and 7, and is followed by the data needed to make
the alteration.  The formats of the various alter types are shown below.

                         COLUMNS    CONTENTS

Alter Bedrooms:            6-7      01
                             8      New number of bedrooms
                           9-95     Blanks

Alter Square Feet:         6-7      02
                           8-11     New square feet
                          12-95     Blanks

Alter Lease Start Date:    6-7      03
                           8-15     New start date (MMDDYYYY)

Alter Lease End Date:      6-7      04
                           8-15     New end date (MMDDYYYY)

Alter Renter Name(s):      6-7      05
                           8-67     New names (up to 4, 15 characters each)
                          68-95     Blanks

Alter Number of Occupants: 6-7      06
                             8      New number of adults
                             9      New number of children
                          10-95     Blanks

Alter Pets:                6-7      07
                             8      New pet code
                           9-95     Blanks

Alter Rent:                6-7      08
                           8-11     New monthly rent
                          12-95     Blanks

Alter Rent Payment:        6-7      09
                           8-9      Which payment to alter (01-12)
                          10-13     New payment amount
                          14-95     Blanks


DELETE Transaction:

To delete a record, no further information is needed beyond the key field and
the transaction code.  Therefore, columns 6-95 will be blank.



OUTPUT
------

Output from a data validation program consists of (1) a file of valid
transactions (having the same format as the input file), and (2) an exception
report, which lists each invalid record along with one message for each error
on the record.  A sample exception report will be handed out separately.


PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------

Verify that the first record in the transaction file is a date record. (A
valid date record has blank spaces in the key field.)  If the first record is
not a date record, or if the date is invalid (i.e., not numeric), print an
error message and terminate the program.  Do NOT code a second STOP RUN to
terminate the program--a structured program must have only one STOP RUN
statement.

If the date record is valid, edit the transaction records, placing all valid
transactions in the edited transaction file.  The edited transaction file must
contain a header record, in the following format:

Header Record:           COLUMNS    CONTENTS
                           1-5      Blanks
                           6-13     File creation date (from date record)
                          14-33     Your last name
                          34-95     Blanks

Use the criteria given below to validate the input records.

FIELD                    EDIT CRITERIA

Apartment ID:
   Building ID           Alphabetic (A, B, C, or D)
   Apartment number      Numeric, greater than zero
Transaction code         Numeric (1, 2, or 3)
Alter code               Numeric, in range 01-09
Apartment/Townhouse      Alphabetic (AP or TN)
Number or bedrooms       Numeric (0, 1, 2, or 3)
Total square feet        Numeric, greater than zero
Lease start date:
   MM                    Numeric, in range 01-12
   DD                    Numeric, in range 01-31
   YYYY                  Numeric
Lease end date:
   MM                    Numeric, in range 01-12
   DD                    Numeric, in range 01-31
   YYYY                  Numeric
Renter name(s)           At least one non-blank entry
Number of occupants:
   Number of adults      Numeric, greater than zero
   Number of children    Numeric
Pets                     Alphabetic (N, C, D, or O)
Monthly rent             Numeric, greater than zero


The exception report must list all invalid transactions along with the
appropriate error message(s) to indicate why the transaction was rejected.  If
a given transaction record has more than one field in error, the report must
print an error message for each invalid field.  Prior to the error message(s)
for a given transaction, print the apartment ID, the transaction code, and the
contents of the rest of the transaction record.  Keep all of the output for a
given transaction on a single page.  Follow the format shown on the sample
report.  Double space before printing the output for the next invalid
transaction record.

At the end of the exception report, print a summary indicating the number of
input transaction records (do not count the header), the number of invalid
transactions, and the number of valid transactions.

Finally, in order to verify the contents of the valid transaction file, close
that file for output, open it for input, and print out each record contained
in the file.  Do not format this output; instead, print each 95-character
record as it exists in the file.


NOTES ON THE FILES
------------------

1.   The unedited input file is stored on disk.  It contains standard labels
     and is a blocked file.  The ASSIGN clause for this file should be ASSIGN
     TO S-TRAN, and the JCL to access it is as follows:

     //GO.TRAN   DD DSN=T90ASS1.SPRING01.APT.TRAN(UNEDITED),DISP=SHR

2.   The edited transaction file created by your program will be a temporary
     disk file.  It must have standard labels and must contain 40 records per
     block.  The ASSIGN clause for this file should be ASSIGN TO S-EDITTRAN,
     and the JCL for it is as follows:

     //GO.EDITTRAN DD DSN=&&EDITED,UNIT=DISK,VOL=SER=ACA302,
     //       SPACE=(TRK,(1,1)),DISP=(NEW,PASS)

3.   The print file for the exception report should be specified as usual.
