                                  60 points
                        Master File Extract and Report
        Date Functions:  CURRENT-DATE, INTEGER-OF-DATE, DATE-OF-INTEGER

                            
ABC Properties, Inc. wants to select records from the master file based on the
following criteria:

                         1.   Apartment/Townhouse indicator   
                         2.   Number of bedrooms
                         3.   Lease end date
                         4.    Monthly rent

The actual values for these criteria are specified in a separate input file
called the parameter file.  By changing the values on the parameter record, it
is possible to select different master file records without modifying the
Cobol program.


Parameter File
--------------

The parameter file contains a single 80-character record:

               COLUMNS        CONTENTS
               1-2            Apartment/Townhouse indicator
                                 AP, TN, or spaces
                                 (Spaces mean that either AP or TN 
                                 meets the criterion.)
                3             Number of bedrooms
                                 0, 1, 2, 3
               4-6            Days to lease end
                                 (A maximum value. 999 means we don't care
                                  when the lease ends.)
               7-10           Monthly rent (upper limit)
                                 (All zeroes mean that any monthly rent meets
                                 the criterion.)
              11-80           Unused

To extract all apartments with 2 bedrooms, a lease that expires within 60
days, and a monthly rent less than or equal to $1000, the parameter record
would read as follows: AP20601000

To extract all 3-bedroom apartments or townhouses with leases that expire
within 30 days, the parameter record would read as follows: bb30300000
(Note: each b represents one blank space.)

To extract all 1-bedroom apartments with a monthly rent less than or equal to
$750, the parameter record would read as follows:  AP19990750
  
Master file records are to be selected ONLY if they meet ALL of the criteria
specified on the parameter record. 

Four different parameter files will be made available for this assignment. 
Three of the files will contain a valid parameter record, and one file will
contain an invalid record.  You should test your program against all of the
parameter files.  Your instructor, however, will tell you which file(s) to use
for the final run(s) in your section.  You may be required to turn in more
than one run, using different parameter files.  If you have written your COBOL
program correctly, you should not have to change it in order to run it with a
different parameter file.

Since the parameter record contains raw input data, it must be validated.  For
each invalid item on the parameter record, display an appropriate error
message.  If any item on the parameter record is invalid, terminate the
program without attempting to extract records from the master file.

The parameter record is valid if it meets the following specifications:

            Apartment/Townhouse -- AP or TN or Spaces
            Number of bedrooms  -- 0, 1, 2, 3
            Days to lease end   -- numeric
            Monthly rent        -- numeric


Master File
-----------

If the parameter record contains valid data, use the values on it to select
records from the master file.  The format of the master file is given in a
separate document.

If a master file record satisfies all of the criteria on the parameter record,
place a record in the extract file and place a detail line on the extract
report. If a master file record fails to satisfy all of the criteria, do
nothing with it.


Extract File
------------

An extract record may contain all or part of the information from a master
file record.  For this assignment, the extract record should contain the first
94 characters of the master file record, i.e., everything but the rent payment
table.

The extract file also must contain a header record, which is to be formatted
the same as the master file header except that the extract header is only 94
characters long.  The date in the extract header should be the same as that in
the master file header.  Add your own name to the header immediately following
the date.
  
After the extract file has been created, close it for output, open it for
input, and print out its contents (unformatted).


Report File
-----------

For every record placed in the extract file, a detail line must appear on the
report.  Sample report output is shown below.  

The formatted date on the report should be the date from the master file
header.  The other values in the report headers are created from the parameter
record.

If the Apartment/Townhouse indicator on the parameter record is spaces, print
EITHER instead of AP or TN.  To get the date the lease must end by: get the
current date, convert it to an integer, add the days on the parm record, and
convert the integer back to a date.  

To determine whether to extract or not based on the date: Convert the lease
end date in the master file to an integer.  If that integer does not fall
within the range of the integer formed from the current date and the integer
formed from the current date plus the number of days on the parm record, do
not extract.

          TOTAL NUMBER OF APARTMENTS EXTRACTED:    2


NOTES:
------
(1)  For efficiency, build the report file at the same time as the extract
     file--that is, read a master file record, determine if it should be
     selected and, if so, create from it both an extract record and a report
     line, then read the next master file record, etc.

(2)  This program has two input files and two output files:

     Apartment Master File (input)
          Sequential file on disk.  Standard labels.  Blocked.
          ASSIGN TO S-MASTER
          //GO.MASTER DD DSN=T90ASS1.SPRING01.APT.MASTER,DISP=SHR

     Parameter File (input)
          Sequential file on disk.  Standard labels.  Blocked.
          ASSIGN TO S-PARM
          //GO.PARM  DD DSN=T90ASS1.SPRING01.PARM(ONE),DISP=SHR
              (To access the variations on the parameter record, instead
               of typing ONE, type TWO, THREE, or FOUR.)

     Extract File (output)
          Specify standard labels and 20 records per block.
          ASSIGN TO S-EXTRACT
          //EXTRACT DD DSN=&&EXT,UNIT=DISK,VOL=SER=ACA302,
          //        SPACE=(TRK,(1,1)),DISP=(NEW,PASS)

     Report File (output)
          Same as previous print files.

(3)  Your program should check for the following possible errors:
          --missing parameter record
          --invalid values in the parameter record
               (Produce an error message for each invalid value.)
          --missing header in the master file
          --invalid header in the master file

     If any of these errors occur, your program should report the error but
     should not attempt to process any master file item records.
