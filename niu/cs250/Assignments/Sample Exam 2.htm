PART 2:  CODING AND INTERPRETING CODE


1.   Short coding (3 points each)

     a.   Write one COBOL statement that will read a record from an input file
          (IN-FILE) and place that record in the area of WORKING-STORAGE defined
          as  01 INPUT-RECORD.  If end of file occurs, set the end-of-file flag to
          'Y'.







          b.   Place parentheses as appropriate to clarify the order of evaluation in
          COBOL.

     4.   Control Break Logic

     Each record in an input file represents one sale.  The record contains the
     sale amount as well as the salesperson's name and the region in which the
     salesperson works.  These records are sorted on REGION, and within the
     region, they are sorted on SALESPERSON-NAME.  From this input data, a
     report is to be printed containing one detail line for each input record,
     plus subtotals for each salesperson, subtotals for the region, and grand
     totals for the whole company.  Write the procedure division code for 100-
     PROCESS-ONE-REGION.  Do not attempt to write the whole program. (15 points)

     NOTE: You do not need to show any data division code, but use good data
     names so we can tell what you are incrementing, saving, or comparing.

                  03    PRODUCT-SALES    PIC 9(6)V99.

     Declare a detail line that can be used to print out the 8 PRODUCT-SALES
     amounts plus the TOTAL-SALES for all 8 product lines.  (10 points)














     Write the PROCEDURE DIVISION code to build and print the detail line you
     declared above.  (10 points)
