This assignment covers these topics: C shell variables, wildcard characters,
redirections, and history.<p>

PART A. C SHELL VARIABLE AND WILDCARD CHARACTERS (2 pts each, 10 pts total)<p>

Give the full UNIX commands to accomplish the following tasks.
You should record your commands in a typescript file to be submitted.<p>

a1. create/define a shell variable called 'linkdir' and initialize it to
the directory pathname: /home/mp/z036473/Assign/csci330<p>

For questions a2 through a10, use the defined variable 'linkdir' and perform  
the following tasks.<p>

a2. List the contents of the 'linkdir' directory.<p>

a3. List all file names starting with a.<p>

a4. List all file names that end with at least one number digit.<p>

a5. List all file names starting with an a or A.<p>

a6. List all file names ending in a period, followed by a number digit.<p>

a7. List all three character file names that begin with an uppercase
 letter.<p>

a8. List all file names ending in 11 or 12.<p>

a9. List all file names ending in x or y.<p>

a10. List all file names containing lowercase ab.<p>


PART B. REDIRECTIONS (2 points each; 10 points total)<p>

For questions b1 through b5, assume the command 'set noclobber' has not
been set.  Give the full UNIX commands to perform the following tasks.
Record your work in a typescript file to be submitted.<p>

b1. Redirect the output of the 'ps' command to a file called 'psfile'.
 Assume 'psfile' does not already exist.<p>

 Display the contents of the 'psfile' file.<p>
 
b2. Append the output of the 'date' command to the file, 'psfile'.<p>
 Assume 'psfile' already exists.<p>

 Display the contents of the 'psfile' file.<p>

b3. Redirect the output and standard error of the the command 
 'cat psfile myfile' to a new file called 'catfile'.
 Assume 'psfile' already exists and 'myfile' does not exist.<p>

 Display the contents of the 'catfile' file.<p>

b4. On a single command line, using command sequences, append all the 
 output of the commands:<p>
 'date', 'quota -v', 'pwd', and  'du' to a new file called 'disk-usage'.<p>

 Display the contents of the 'disk-usage' file.<p>

b5.  Create a symbolic link, called 'link.sample1.c' to a C program 
 named 'sample1.c'located in: /home/mp/z036473/Cprograms
 Using the 'gcc' command, compile the file 'link.sample1.c' and 
 send the standard output and diagnostic/error output to a file 
 called 'error.out'.<p>

 Display the contents of the 'error.out' file.<p>


PART C. C SHELL HISTORY (2 points each; 20 points total)<p>

During login, the login process checks to see if the file ~/.history exists.  
If it does, the commands in that file become the first commands in the 
history list.<p>

Execute the following commands.  Note that you should not create the following
three commands in a typescript file yet.<p>

 cp /home/mp/z036473/dot.history ~/.history<br>
 unset savehist<br>
 login<p>

Now you can execute/record all of the commands listed below in a typescript 
file to be submitted.<p>
After you are logged in again, type the command:<p>
 history<p>

You should see:<p>
<ul>
     1  echo First Second Third Fourth Fifth Sixth Seventh Eighth<br>
     2  echo AAA BBB CCC DDD EEE AAA BBB CCC DDD EEE<br>
     3  echo 111 222 111 222 111 222 111 222<br>
     4  echo hello goodbye here there where goodbye hello<br>
     5  history<p>

Now, execute the following commands, and explain what the labeled ones do
(c1 - 10). <p>

set prompt = '\!mp% '<br>
set history = 22<br>
echo $history $prompt<p>

c1. history -r<br>
c2. history -h<br>
c3. !4<br>
c4. !!<br>
c5. !?Six<br>
c6. eko hello Sam<br>
c7. ^k^ch<br>
c8. ^Sam^Mary and Joe^<br>
c9. !3:s/1/7/<br>
c10. !3:gs/222/7777/<br>
