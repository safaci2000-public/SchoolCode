CSCI330              Assignment #7                     Fall 2001
                C Shell Aliases
                      (50 points)

</pre>

You can create a new command by using the C shell alias feature, or
by writing a shell script.  For this assignment, you will be
interpreting commands and then creating C shell aliases.<p>

Part A.  INTERPRETING ALIAS/COMMANDS (2 points each; 6 points total)<p>

a1. Enter the following commands:<ul>

      mkdir tmp<br>
      alias 2tmp 'cd tmp; pwd'<br>
      2tmp<p>

      What does the '2tmp' command do?<p>
</ul>

a2.   Enter the following command:<ul>

      alias<p>

      What does the 'alias' command do?<p>
</ul>

a3.   Enter the following commands:<ul>

      unalias 2tmp<br>
      2tmp<p>

      What does the 'unalias' command do?<p>
</ul>

Part B. CREATING ALIASES (45 points total)<p>
For this part of the assignment, you will create an alias that:<ul>
      a) redefines an existing UNIX command,<br>
      b) accepts zero arguments, and<br>
      c) accepts one or more argument.<p>
</ul>

b1. (2 points) Create an alias definition called 'h' to display only the
most recent (last) 10 commands.  This alias does not accept any argument.<p>

b2. (6 points) Redefine the 'ls' command so that its output is displayed
always as 3 columns, in round robin order (sort across row), and all
directory names are marked with a slash (/) at the end and executable file
names are marked with an asterisk at the end. This alias does not accept
any argument. Check the man page on pr<p>

Here is an example of the output of the redefined 'ls' command:<p>
<pre>
      % ls
      Assignments/     ClassList/      alias
      re.file*         re.file,v*      re.file.out
</pre>

b3. (7 points) Create an alias definition called 'rename' to rename a file
or a directory.  This alias accepts only one argument, which is the name of
a file or a directory. Rename the file so that it has an extension that is
a contiguous sequence of digits representing the current time consisting of
the year (4 digit), day of year, hour, minute, and second of day.  See date
and strftime(3c) man pages.<p>

b4. (7 points) Create an alias called 'printcsl' to send one or more output
file to the CSL lab printer. This alias accepts one or more arguments, which
is the file name(s). Use enscript as the print command and use its options
to print the file's name and time of printing at the top of each page.<p>

b5. (7 points) Create an alias definition called 'where' to find a file and
list the absolute pathname of the file found. Start search from current
directory.  This alias accepts one argument, which is a file name.<p>

b6. (7 points) Create an alias called 'cd' which will change your directory
and change the command prompt to include:
<ul>
  - the full pathname of your current working directory,<br>
  - the history event number, and<br>
  - the percentage sign (%).<p>
</ul>

This alias accepts one argument, which is the name of a directory. Note that
you need to change to a directory to see your new prompt that include the
above information. Each time your change to a directory, you should see
information similar to this:<br>

<ul>
/home/mp/z036473/csci330<p>
</ul>

b7. (8 points) Create an alias called 'mylink' which will create a symbolic
link (in your current working directory) to a csci330 assignment in the
directory: /home/ux/krush/unix-assignments<p>

This alias accepts one argument, which is the exact name of the assignment
file.  For example: assign5.fall01<p>

Here is an example on using the 'mylink' alias.<br>
<ul>
% mylink assign5.fall01<p>
</ul>
