Bourne shell programming - tentative<br>
Part 1 60 points<br>
<p>
Update: The following is a program and like all programs in CSCI, you
must include documentation with the code.<p>

Syntax: Clean [directory_name] [-c-o-O{-s ####}{-n name}]<p>

Using find and various other Unix commands in a Bourne shell script, 
you are to create a program that will remove various files found in 
you directories. You can call the program Clean.<p>

Clean will take either command line arguments (part 1) or provide user 
with a menu of actions (part 2) indicating the desired actions. Choices 
are to delete core files (generated when a program crashes), delete 
files with obj extensions (created when a program is compiled from 
source code), delete files of a specified size, or delete files of a 
name specified by the user.<p>

Clean will use find to generate a list of files of interest. In some 
case, find may be able to both find and remove the files. In other 
cases, find must be used with other commands to allow better control 
by the user.<p>

If an option/arguments are specified when Clean is invoked, the 
following option/argument action relationship will be implemented.<p>

dname - start search/delete in the directory indicated otherwise assume
the current working directory as the starting point.<p>

-c - remove all core files without any further interaction by user.<p>

-o - remove all files with obj extensions. However, prompt user before 
deleting each found file. Use the conditional option of find to prompt.<p>

-O - remove all files with obj extensions without any further 
interaction by user.<p>

-s #### - selectively remove files that are of the number of bytes 
specified by ####. #### may be signed. Use find to get the list of
files. If numer is signed, then - indicates files of interest will be 
smaller than specified, if +, then larger, and if no sign, then 
of an exact size.  Use the ls command on each element of the list created
by find and show long listing for the located file and prompt user 
before deleting found file. Use the for loop to parse though 
this list, displaying the retrieved data and invoke a separate rm 
command on the files the user approves for deleting.<p>

-n name - selectively remove all files that match the name specified 
by name. Use the long listing and for loop as with the size option.<p>

The main body of the program<p>

For the assignment, replace the rm command with an echo of the rm command
and any arguments. This will protect against accidentally deleting something
important and also allow to repeatedly test the program without having to
constantly recreate the files being deleted. Hand the program in in this form.
<p>

Test to see if the 1st argument does not start with a - indicating that 
it is not an option. If 1st argument is not an option, test that the 1st 
argument is a valid directory name. If it is valid, save in a variable 
and discard the 1st command line argument (shift). This will move the 
second argument, if it exists, into the 1st argument position. Otherwise 
if it is not an option and not a valid directory, indicate that 1st argument 
is problematic and terminate.<p>

Use a case to test the 1st argument in the command line argument list.<p>

If the option is -c, then delete all core files. Use find to generate the
list of files to delete and to issue the delete command. Use the
non-interactive option (-exec).<p>

If the option is -o, then use find to delete all files with a .obj extension.
Use finds interactive option (-ok) or use rm -i to invoke an interactive form
of the rm command. Remember to only echo the rm command.<p>

If the option is -O, then use find to delete all files with a .obj extension.
Use finds non-interactive option (-exec).<p>

If the option is -s, then test (use grep) the second argument on the command
line for a valid numeric syntax. A single sign of + or - is acceptable at the
beginning of the argument. If second argument is missing or non-numeric
argument, if part A, terminate the program with a message explaining 
the problem, else if part b, print the message explaining the problem and 
continue at the top of the main driver loop. If opions are valid, then use 
find with the size listing option in a for statement to generate and parse 
the list of identified files. Then use ls on individual filenames and show 
the statistic found for each file, prompt the user to confirm deletion and 
proceed accordingly.<p>

If the option is -n, then treat the second argument as the filename to 
search for. If the filename was quoted when specified on the command line, 
wild cards may be included and should be honored. If second argument is 
missing or invalid file, for part 1, print an error message describing 
problem and terminate. For part 2, you will print a message and return to 
the top of the driver loop.<p>

Else if the option is un-identifyable, indicate problem, set a return code of
non-zero and terminate.<p>
