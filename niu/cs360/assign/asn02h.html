Run the following program:
<PRE>
DUMP1    CSECT 
         USING DUMP1,15             ESTABLISH A BASE REGISTER 
         L     1,ONE                LOAD THE FIRST NUMBER INTO R1 
         L     2,TWO                LOAD THE SECOND INTO R2 
         AR    1,2                  ADD THE TWO NUMBERS 
         ST    1,THREE              STORE THE RESULT 
         XDUMP THREE,4              DUMP THE RESULT 
         BCR   B'1111',14           RETURN TO CALLER 
* 
ONE      DC    F'64'                FIRST NUMBER 
TWO      DC    F'32'                SECOND NUMBER 
EOFFLAG  DC    C'0' A               FLAG SAVE AREA 
THREE    DS    CL4' '               SUM OF THE TWO NUMBERS 
         END   DUMP1
</PRE>	 
Use the resulting output to answer the following questions:
<OL>
<P><LI>What is the address of the next instruction which will be executed?</LI>
<P><LI>What is the address of the instruction that caused the abend?</LI>
<P><LI>What type of error occurred?</LI>
<P><LI>What actually causes this error?</LI>
<P><LI>Correct the error by rewriting the section of code that caused it.</LI>
<P><LI>What is the contents of register 1 in decimal?</LI>
<P><LI>What does the value in reg 1 represent at the time of ABEND?</LI>
<P><LI>Why is the LOC address of the storage area with the label ONE on it 000018 when the branch statement before it whose LOC address is 000014 only takes up 2 bytes?</LI>
<P><LI>What are the contents of the two bytes of user storage starting at address 000016? <BR>What do they represent?</LI>
<P><LI>What are the contents of the byte saved at address 00001B? <BR>Does this byte represent the first byte of a full word?</LI>

<P><LI>Which of the following are synonyms for the same length? [There may be more than one group of synonyms.]
<OL TYPE="a"><LI>6 hex digits</LI>
<LI>4 bytes</LI> 
<LI>8 hex digits </LI>
<LI>32 bytes </LI>
<LI>32 bits </LI>
<LI>1 doubleword </LI>
<LI>1 fullword </LI>
<LI>1 byte</LI> 
<LI>1 foot </LI>
<LI>64 bits</LI>
<LI>1 halfword</LI>
<LI>1 meter</LI></OL></LI>
<P><LI>If the dump program error were corrected, what value would the storage area at label THREE contain?</LI>
<P><LI>What two instructions have you worked with which cause data conversion to take
place?</LI>
<P><LI>What is the decimal equivalent of hex 0002BA14 ?</LI>
</OL>
