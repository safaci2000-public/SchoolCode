<h2>Overview</h2>

<P>The law firm of Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe would like you to write a program 
to produce a report listing the income generated by its staff of lawyers. The 
input to the program will be an unknown number of records, each containing a 
6-digit id number, a 2-digit rank number, the number of hours billed, and the 
deduction rate separated by spaces (see SAMPLE INPUT).</P>
<P>For each input record you should print a detail line containing: the id 
number, rank number, number of hours billed, deduction amount (in cents), gross 
income (in cents), and net income (in cents). After processing all of the input 
records, print summary lines with the total number of employees and the average 
net income generated (in cents). (Don’t worry about trying to round to the 
nearest cent, just use the quotient as the average.)</P>
<P>Use the following formulas in your calculations:</P>
<DIR>
<P>Gross income = Hours billed * hourly rate</P>
<P>Deduction amount = Gross income * deduction rate / 1000</P>
<P>Net income = Gross income – Deduction amount</P></DIR>
<P>The hourly rate is determined by the lawyer’s rank in the firm. If the rank 
number is 11, the rate is $100.00 per hour. If the rank is 22, the rate is 
$125.00 per hour. If the rank is 33, the rate is $150.00 per hour.</P>
