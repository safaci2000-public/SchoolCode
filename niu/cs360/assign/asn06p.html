<PRE>
     "CD Empire" is a chain of music outlets in the Dallas/Ft.Worth 
area.  Due to the recent success of mp3 online music, sales have declined
and Empire has decided to close a number of stores and consolidate 
inventory.  You have been asked to write an assembler program to merge
the inventory databases for two of the stores into a single database.  
In addition, your program should be able to update the weekely transactions.

	Your program must sort and print the current stock information from 
each store.  Then is should merge the two databases into one and print another 
listing.  Finally it will apply a number of transactions to the database for 
updating.  A listing of the updated stock must be printed, and lastly a full 
listing of of the updated database should be printed.

INPUT:
------

     There are three sets of input data, all contained in a single
file:

1)   The first two sets of data each contain an unknown number of 
     records (less than 20).  The records have the same format as 
     the records from Assignment 5, as follows:

               Columns          Description
               -------          -----------
                 1-6            Stock Number (numeric data)
                 7              Blanks
                8-31            Artist       (character data)
                32              Blank
                33-56           CD Title     (character data)
                57              Blank
                58-60           Number of Copies in Stock 
                                             (numeric data)
                61              Blank
                62-66           Price        (numeric data)
                67-80           Unused

     The end of each of the first two sets of data is marked by a
record with a stock number of 000000.  Do not put this record into the
table.  These data sets will be used to build two tables which will
eventually be merged.

2)   The third set of data contains an unknown number of transaction
     records.  Each contains a CD title in columns 1-24.  These 
     titles are used in the search portion of your program to
     update the newly merged table.  The format of the transaction 
     report is as follows: 

               Columns          Description
               -------          -----------
                1-24            CD Title
               28-30            Number of CDs sold that week
     

     For each record in the transaction file, look up the corresponding 
     title in the merged table and update the quantity of CDs by 
     subtracting the quantity sold from the quantity in stock. Then 
     print the entire updated entry for that CD.  Finally, print the full 
     updated databse.

OUTPUT:
-------

     The output from this program will consist of five reports:

     The first two reports will be sorted listings of the two tables
that were built from the first two input data sets.  These reports
should list CD stock information in ASCENDING order by STOCK NUMBER.  

     The third report will be a listing of the table containing 
the merged stock information from both music stores.

     The fourth report will be a transaction report which will contain
a listing of CD information.  For each CD TITLE in the transaction data, 
there should be a detail line in the transaction report.  


     The fifth report will be a print out of the entire updated 
merged table.


     The following is a sample report.  USE THE SAME FORMAT FOR 
ALL FIVE REPORTS.

                              
             COMBINED CD STOCK FOR DALLA/FT. WORTH AREA

STOCK NUMBER      ARTIST                TITLE        QUANTITY        PRICE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
   111822       SCOTT, JILL       WHO IS JILL SCOTT?    26            1489


PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS:
------------------------

1)  You should use at least 6 internal subroutines:  MAIN, BUILD, 
SORT, PRINT, MERGE, and UPDATE.

MAIN: Calls the other routines as needed, passing the appropriate
parameters to each one.  All three tables should be defined in MAIN. 
MAIN should have the following logic:

     - call BUILD to build the first table
     - call SORT to sort the first table
     - print page headings for the first report
     - call PRINT to print the first report
     - call BUILD to build the second table
     - call SORT to sort the second table
     - print page headings for the second report
     - call PRINT to print the second report
     - call MERGE to merge the two sorted tables
     - print page headings for the third report
     - call PRINT to print the third report
     - print page headings for the fourth report
     - call UPDATE to apply the weekly transactions 
       data to the table and then, after the table 
       entry has been updated, print a detail line 
       containg all data for that CD contained in 
       the table entry
     - print page headings for the fifth report
     - call PRINT to print the fifth report

BUILD: Reads from the input file and puts the information into a table
as it is read.

     INPUT PARAMETERS:  
     - beginning of table address 
     - address of a fullword in which to store the address of 
       the next available entry in the table, ANA
     - address of an 80 byte input area

SORT: Uses the selection sort algorithm to sort the contents of a
table in ascending order by STOCK NUMBER.

     INPUT PARAMETERS:  
     - beginning of table address
     - address of the FW that contains the address of the next 
       available table entry, ANA

PRINT: Prints the contents of a table.

     INPUT PARAMETERS:  
     - beginning of table address
     - address of the FW that contains the table address of the 
       next available entry, ANA

MERGE: Merges two sorted tables of CD stock information.  The resulting
table will also be in ASCENDING order by STOCK NUMBER.  A number of the CDs 
have duplicate stock numbers which should be appropriately handled by the 
merge routine as follows:  

     The quantity of stock should be aded 
     and the sum entered in the merged table.

     The two prices should be compared and 
     the larger of the two values should be 
     entered into the merged table.

The merge algorithm to use can be found on page 153 of the 
Course Notes.

     INPUT PARAMETERS:  
     - beginning of table1 address
     - address of the FW that contains ANA    
     - beginning of table2 address
     - address of the FW that contains ANA    
     - beginning of merged table address
     - address of a FW that will hold ANA for the merged table       
       address

UPDATE: Reads records from a transaction file and prints a
transaction report.  Each transaction record contains a single CD TITLE.  
You should do a sequential search on the merged table for each
CD TITLE read from a record.  If a match is found, you should do 
the following: 

Update the merged table by subtracting the number of CDs sold 
that week, found on the transaction record, from the amount in stock, 
found in the table entry. Print a detail line containing ALL information 
about the CD, otherwise print the TITLE and an appropriate "NOT FOUND" 
message.  The transaction report format should otherwise be the same as 
for the other four reports.

     INPUT PARAMETERS:  
     - beginning of merged table address 
     - address of a FW that holds ANA   
     - address of an 80 byte input area
     
2)   Start each report at the top of a new page, single space your  
     detail lines, and make sure that the report is neatly centered
     on the page.

3)   Declare the two tables to be merged so that they will each hold
     a maximum of 20 elements.  Declare the merged table so that it
     will hold 40 elements.  The format of each table element should
     be the same as it was for Assignment 5.  Define the tables as
     follows:

      Each entry in the table should have the following format:

         SIZE                  STORED
       ---------             ----------
       FULLWORD              Stock Number
       24 bytes              Artist Name
       24 bytes              CD Title
       FULLWORD              Quantity in Stock
       FULLWORD              Price
       FULLWORD              Unused



 	  Declare your three tables in your MAIN CSECT.  In the line 
      immediately before each of the three tables you should you 
      should include this set of instructions:
                                        
                   ORG   MAIN+((*-MAIN+31)/32*32)      
                   DC    CL32'           TABLE 1 STARTS HERE'            
 
     You should have similar code before table 2 and again before 
     table 3.  This code will help you locate your tables in a dump. 
     You should check that your tables are correctly built and sorted
     BEFORE proceeding to write the the merge routine.
       
4)   The length of your program will likely exceed 4096 bytes and you 
     will get addressability errors UNLESS YOU ESTABLISH ADDRESSABILITY 
     WITH TWO BASE REGISTERS.  Use the following code to establish
     addressability:

          MAIN    CSECT
                  LA    R12,4095(,R15)
                  LA    R12,1(,R12)
                  USING MAIN,R15,R12

     DO NOT alter the contents of register 12 beyond this point!

5)   Test the program with your own data.  Replace your data with the
     following JCL for the final run:

     <A HREF="../data/data6.txt">//FT05F001 DD DSN=T90MES1.C360(DATA6),DISP=SHR</A>

 6)  A copy of all 5 reports can be seen outside Rm. 559 in the 
     Computer Science Building.
