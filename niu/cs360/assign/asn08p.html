<PRE>
     For this assignment you will revisit the Merge Tables program you 
wrote for Assignment 6.  This time you should rewrite the program using 
Standard Linkage to make each of the Internal Subroutines into an External 
Subroutine.  Your program should already have the following internal 
subroutines: 

     MAIN 
     BUILD
     SORT
     PRINT 
     MERGE
     UPDATE
	 
Now you insert the proper standard linkage. 

INPUT:
------
You should use the same data you used for Assignment 6.  As before, the 
data set is divided into records to be inserted into TABLE 1, records for 
TABLE 2 and TRANSACTION records for the UPDATE.  A sentinel record of six 
numeric zeros 000000 indicates the division in the data file between the 
three sets of records.

OUTPUT:
-------

The output from this program should have the same format as Assignment 6.
PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS:
------------------------

1)  Your program must have at least 6 separate CSECTs: MAIN, BUILD, SORT, 
PRINT, MERGE, and UPDATE.  Your MAIN CSECT must be the last one in the
assembly, and the END instruction must specify MAIN as the entry point.

2)  Each of your CSECTs MUST follow the standard linkage conventions for 
subroutine calls, parameter passing, saving and restoring registers, etc. 
(see pp. 76-89 of the Course Notes for details).

3)  You may need to establish a second base register, as before.  If you 
do, be careful not to use registers included in the standard linkage.

4) You should use the CVB instruction to convert the Stock Number, Number 
of Copies, and Price into binary before inserting them into your table.  
Your sort routine should sort the CD stock information in ASCENDING order 
by STOCK NUMBER.  To print the Stock Number and Number of Copies, use the 
CVD instruction to convert them to packed decimal and then move/edit them 
with ED.  To print the Price, use the CVD instruction to convert it to 
packed decimal and then insert commas, decimals and dollar sign using 
EDMK.  You may NOT use XDECI and XDECO in this program.

5)  The first two sets of data each contain an unknown number of records 
(less than 20).  The records have the same format as the records from 
Assignment 6, as follows:

               Columns          Description
               -------          -----------
                 1-6            Stock Number (numeric data)
                 7              Blanks
                8-31            Artist       (character data)
                32              Blank
                33-56           CD Title     (character data)
                57              Blank
                58-60           Number of Copies in Stock 
                                             (numeric data)
                61              Blank
                62-66           Price        (numeric data)
                67-80           Unused

     The end of each of the first two sets of data is marked by a record 
with a stock number of 000000.  Do not put this record into the table.  
These data sets will be used to build two tables which will eventually be 
merged.

6)   The third set of data contains an unknown number of transaction 
records.  Each contains a CD title in columns 1-24.  These titles are used 
in the search portion of your program to update the newly merged table.  
The format of the transaction report is as follows: 

               Columns          Description
               -------          -----------
               1-24             CD Title
               25-27            Blank
               28-30            Number of CDs sold that week

7)   Declare the two tables to be merged so that they will each hold a 
maximum of 20 elements.  Declare the merged table so that it will hold 40 
elements.  The format of each table element should be the same as it was 
for Assignment 6.  Define the tables as follows:

         SIZE                  STORED
       ---------             ----------
       FULLWORD              Stock Number
       24 bytes              Artist Name
       24 bytes              CD Title
       FULLWORD              Quantity in Stock
       FULLWORD              Price
       FULLWORD              Unused

As before, declare your three tables in your MAIN CSECT.  In the line 
immediately before each of the three tables you include this set of 
instructions:
                                        
                   ORG   MAIN+((*-MAIN+31)/32*32)      
                   DC    CL32'           TABLE 1 STARTS HERE'  
 
8)   Test the program with your own data.  Replace your data with the
     following JCL for the final run:
