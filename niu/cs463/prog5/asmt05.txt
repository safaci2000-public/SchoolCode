Fall-2002                      (100 pts)                                        
            Building Code Word that will correct Errors in Transmission

            Read pp.61-64 (Section 2.2.4) of the text by Tanenbaum, and
           study "Network Architecture: Hamming Codes & Cyclic Redundancy 
            for Transmission Error Correction" from the course web page.   


Part I  (50 points)
Answer the questions on Pages 2 & 3 of this assignment.


Part II (50 points)
1. From j:\c463\fa02 (or http://www.cs.niu.edu/~sjchung/c463),
   copy Prog05.hlp, Prog05.in, and Prog05.sjc into your directory.

2. While you don't have to use the Prog05.hlp file, 
   it further explains this assignment.  

3. In case you should choose to use this file, complete its 
   "buildCodeWord" function and rename Prog05.hlp as Prog05.c.

4. Complile and link/edit your Prog05.c to get Prog05.obj and Prog05.exe.

5. Run your Prog05.exe by the DOS command: Prog05 < Prog05.in > Prog05.out
   Your Prog05.out should compare correctly to Prog05.sjc.


Hand in:
1) Page 2 of this assignment (check your answers again).
2) Printed copies of your Prog05.asm and Prog05.out.
3) Your 3.5" diskette, containing the following your files: 
   Prog05.c(well-documented), Prog05.obj, Prog05.exe, and Prog05.out.

Before you try these questions, 
get printed copies of the Prog05.hlp, Prog05.in and Prog05.sjc files
in j:\c463\fa02 (or http://www.cs.niu.edu/~sjchung/c463) and study them.


Given: Message Word = "11" =  m1 m2, thus m = length of Message Word = 2  

1. Compute r = Number of Check Bits for Correcting 1-bit Transmission Errors  
           
             = ______ bits

   Show your work: 



2. n = Length of Code Word to build for Correcting 1-bit Transmission Errors
  
     = _____ bits


3. Denoting the check bits by c1, c2, . . , and the message word bits by m1, m2, . . , 
   indicate their positions in Code Word:  
 

   Code Word = ___ ___ ___ ___ ___     
                          1   2   3   4   5                       


4. Build the code word, showing p[] and c[][]. 
  

      p[] = {           } = {       }

   c[0][] = {           } = {       }

   c[1][] = {           } = {       }

   c[2][] = {           } = {       }

 
  Code Word = ____________

5. Consider building Code Words of length n bits for Message Words of length m bits
   as a function f: where I is the set of natural numbers, where m = 2 for

   the above problem (e.g., Message Word = "11").  Then,


   1) n = _____ 
      
   2)  = _____    


   3) When the Code Word for the Message Word "00" is transmitted, the word received  
      at the destination may not be exactly the same as the one sent. i.e., there     
      might have been transmission errors (errors in transmission). 

 
     a) Total Number of no transmission errors    = ____  


      b) Total Number of 1-bit transmission errors = ____  


      c) Total Number of 2-bit transmission errors = ____  


      d) Total Number of 3-bit transmission errors = ____  


      e) Total Number of 4-bit transmission errors = ____  

            

      f) Total Number of 5-bit transmission errors = ____
