this config files assumes the input of 4 variables to produce its output.

taking as input a, b, c, d and giving the result as e, f and g.

   a  b
   c  d
________
e  f  g


because of that, this config files uses 3 outputs each for each of the binary variables.

e = ab`c + acd` + a`bcd + abd + acd`
f = a`b`c + a`cd` + abc` + ac`d` + a`bc`d + abcd
g = b`d + bd`

lines 1 is the config line.
2-5 corresponds to e.
6-11 corresponds to f
12-13 corresponds to g
last 3 lines deal with how the output is handeled.
