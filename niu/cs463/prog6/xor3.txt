the config files is based on the assumption that it takes 3 binary vars.

based on the truth table the following cases are the only ones that will produce a true result:

  abc
  a`b`c
  a`bc`
  ab`c`

hence the config files checks for these occurances, if they are not found, the output is assumed to be 0.

config files uses each of these statements.
