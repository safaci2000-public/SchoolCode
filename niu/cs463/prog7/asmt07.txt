                        Cache Memory Mappings                          

        Section 4.5     Improving Performance (pp. 264-282)
        Section 4.5.1   Cache Memory          (pp. 265-270)


For this Assignment, read again Chapter 4 (MicroArchitecture Level) in general
and Section 4.5.1 (Cache Memory) in particular, and the notes in the Prog06.hlp
file to understand the concept for the hierarchy of memory subsystems and for 
the Cache Memory Mappings (Associative, Direct and Set Associative).       

Note that the Associative Cache Mapping uses the first available space (slots)
in Cache Memory, which is not discussed in the text by Tanenbaum. Also, assume
a unified (not split, hence both instructions and data in Cache) Level 1 Cache
(i.e., there is only one Cache Memory).
 
Step 1. From the Course Web Page (http://www.cs.niu.edu/~sjchung)
        copy Prog07.hlp, Prog07.in and Prog07.sjc, and bring your 
        (printed) copies of the files to the class, Monday, 10/28/02.

Step 2. Complete the questions on Page 2 of this assignment.

Step 3. Complete Prog07.hlp after you have understood what is provided 
        for you and what is to be done (completed) by you.

Step 4. After you complete Prog07.hlp, rename it as Prog07.c, and
        "Build" (Compile & Link/Edit) it to get Prog07.exe.

Step 5. Then, run your Prog07.exe by: Prog07 < Prog07.in > Prog07.out.
        Your Prog07.out should compare correctly to Prog07.sjc.

Step 6. Hand in:
        1) Page 2 of this assignment.
        2) Your 3.5" diskette, containing the files: your Prog07.c, Prog07.obj,
           Prog07.exe and Prog07.out, along with Prog07.in & Prog07.sjc.
        3) Printed Copies of your Prog07.c and Prog07.out.

For the following questions, assume:  
1) Size of Main Memory  = 64M bytes
2) Size of Cache Memory = 64K bytes
3) Block Size = Slot Size = 32 bytes/block (or slot)
4) Set Size   = 2 slots/set (= 64 bytes/set)
