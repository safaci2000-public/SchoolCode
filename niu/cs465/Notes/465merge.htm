<p><b>COBOL MERGE verb</b></p>

</font><font face="Courier New" size=3>

<p>The MERGE verb takes two or more files of sorted input records and merges 
them in ascending or descending order by one or more programmer specified keys
into one sorted file.</p>

<p><pre>Format:  MERGE  sd-file-name
            ON ASCENDING/DESCENDING KEY  sd-key-name

            USING fd-name1  fd-name2  ...

            |GIVING merged-file-name         |
            |OUTPUT PROCEDURE IS routine-name|.


   sd-file-name      a temporary merge work file
                     SD in the DATA DIVISION
                     SELECT statement in the ENVIRONMENT DIVISION
                     MUST be CLOSED when the merge begins


   sd-key-name       key field from the SD record description
   

   USING fd-name1  fd-name2    these are the files to be merged
                               FDs in the DATA DIVISION
                               SELECT statements
                               MUST be CLOSED when the merge begins
         

   GIVING merged-file-name    this is the resulting merged file
                              FD in the DATA DIVISION
                              SELECT statement
                              MUST be CLOSED when the merge starts
   

   OUTPUT PROCEDURE IS routine-name
   
      - routine-name is a programmer coded routine that will
        manipulate the records AFTER they are merged
        
      - rules are the same as the SORT output routine




SORT-RETURN    after a MERGE this will contain a return code
               
               0    success, 16   failure
               
               if a programmer moves a non-zero value to this
               register, the sort will stop on the next RETURN
