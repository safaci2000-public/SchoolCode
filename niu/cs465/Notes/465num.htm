<b><p>COBOL numeric formats</p></b>
</font><font face="Courier New" size=3>

<p>The format is specified by using the <b>USAGE IS</b> clause.</p>

<p>There are four formats:</p>

</font><font face="Courier New" size=4>
<p><pre>
  DISPLAY    zoned decimal number
             1 character/byte
             default

  COMP-3     packed decimal number
             2 digits/byte - last byte contains the sign digit

  COMP       binary number
             S9     to S9(4)   - stored as 2 bytes
             S9(5)  to S9(9)   - stored as 4 bytes
             S9(10) to S9(18)  - stored as 8 bytes
             NOT aligned on a specific boundary
             also known as COMP-4

  COMP SYNC  binary number on a specific boundary
             S9     to S9(4)   - stored as 2 bytes on halfword
             S9(5)  to S9(9)   - stored as 4 bytes on fullword
             S9(10) to S9(18)  - stored as 8 bytes on fullword


  01  FLD-A   PIC  S9(5)   USAGE IS DISPLAY.

  01  FLD-B   PIC  S9(5)   COMP-3.

  01  FLD-C   PIC  S9(5)   COMP.

  01  FLD-D   PIC  S9(5)   USAGE IS COMP SYNC.
</pre></p>

<p>Using COMP SYNC can cause "slack bytes" to be embedded within the WORKING
STORAGE because of the forced alignment.  This can affect questions as to the
size of table entry, or computing the size of a record.</p>

<p>Anything on an 01 level is automatically on a doubleword boundary.</p>

<p>COBOL performs the conversions between numeric formats automatically.</p>

<p>Usage guidelines:</p>

</font><font face="Courier New" size=4>
<p><pre>
  DISPLAY    numerical items that will not be used for arithmetic and
             will be printed

  COMP-3     numerical items that will be used in arithmetic and           
             will eventually be printed

  COMP       numerical items that will be used ONLY for arithmetic and
             will NOT be printed


  01  FLD-A   PIC  S9(5)   USAGE IS DISPLAY  VALUE 23.

         stored as 5 bytes:  F0 F0 F0 F2 F3


  01  FLD-B   PIC  S9(5)   COMP-3  VALUE 23.

         stored as 3 bytes:  00 02 3F
                                     

  01  FLD-C   PIC  S9(5)   COMP  VALUE 23.

         stored as 4 bytes:  00 00 00 17
