<p>Parameters can be supplied to the Compiler, Loader, and Linkage Editor by
adding the PARM parameter to the EXEC statement.</p>

</font><font face="Courier New" size=4>
<p><pre>
Format:   PARM='string'  or   PARM=(string)

   string   a maximum of 100 characters


   - this parameter is used to pass values to the program or procedure
     that is being executed

<p><b>COBOL Compiler Options</b></p>

<p><pre>
  APOST
  QUOTE or Q  (default)

    - this option determines which type of punctuation is used to
      enclose literals


  SOURCE or S  (default)
  NOSOURCE or NOS

    - this option determines whether or not the source code is printed
      in the output


  LINECOUNT(nnn) or LC(nnn)

    - this option determines the number of lines printed on each page
      of the printout

    - default: 60 lines per page


  OFFSET or OFF
  NOOFFSET or NOOFF  (default)

    - this option (OFFSET) produces a condensed list of all COBOL verbs
      in the PROCEDURE DIVISION

    - the list includes: the COBOL verb, statement number, and
      relative location of the verb


  LIST
  NOLIST  (default)

    - this option (LIST) produces an ASSEMBLER listing of the
      PROCEDURE DIVISION

    - also gives the location and size of WORKING STORAGE, and a
      table of all literals used in the program

    - LIST and OFFSET are mutually exclusive.  If both are specified,
      LIST is ignored and OFFSET is used


  LIB
  NOLIB  (default)

    - this option (LIB) is used if the COBOL COPY verb is going to
      be used


  MAP
  NOMAP  (default)

    - this option (MAP) produces a map of the DATA DIVISION which lists
      the source code line number, COBOL level number, source code data
      name, base locator, displacement from base locator, data type,
      attributes and ASSEMBLER definition
      PROCEDURE DIVISION


  FLAG(x,y) or F(x,y)
  FLAG(x)
  NOFLAG  (default)

    - this option (FLAG) controls which diagnostic messages are
      printed at the end of the listing (x value) and embedded within
      the listing (y value)

    - messages with a level greater than or equal to x are printed

    - if y is specified, it must be greater than or equal to x and
      SOURCE must be specified as an option

    - if y is specified, then messages with a level greater than or
      equal to y are printed

    - valid options for x and y:

         I  informational         (return code of 0)
         W  warning               (return code of 4)
         E  error                 (return code of 8)
         S  severe error          (return code of 12)
         U  unrecoverable error   (return code of 16)


  VBREF
  NOVBREF  (default)

    - this option (VBREF) produces a list of all COBOL verbs that were
      used and how many times that they were used


  XREF or X or XREF(FULL)
  XREF(SHORT)
  NOXREF or NOX  (default)

    - this option (XREF) produces a sorted cross referenced list of all
      data and procedure names

    - combined with the option SOURCE, an embedded cross reference
      which gives the line number of the data item definition used in
      the COBOL statement will also be produced

    - SHORT will put only the items that were specifically referenced
      in the PROCEDURE DIVISION in the listing


  TEST(hook,symbol)
  NOTEST  (default)

    - this option (TEST) will generate the line number of the
      statement that caused the program to ABEND

    - hook  -  specifies which lines will be flagged for errors

         BLOCK   program entry and exit points
         PATH    BLOCK plus all branching points (IF, EVALUATE, etc.)
         STMT    PATH plus all statements
         ALL     same as STMT
         NONE    nothing

    - symbol  -  specifies whether a formatted dump will be produced

         SYM     produce a formatted dump
         NOSYM   no dump

    - if SYM is used, then the runtime option TERMTHDACT(DUMP) and
      the DD card //CEEDUMP  DD  SYSOUT=* are required

    - when TEST is used as an option, TEST(ALL,SYM) is the default


  SSRANGE or SSR
  NOSSRANGE or NOSSR  (default)

    - this option (SSRANGE) will check that subscript/index values
      fall within the appropriate range

</pre></p>

<p><b>Run time options:</b></p>

<p><pre>
  - options that are invoked when the program is run


  Fetch step format:   PARM='user options/runtime options'

      PARM='/CHECK(ON)'  or  PARM='/TERMTHDACT(DUMP)'


  Loader step format:  PARM='loader option/user option/runtime option'

      PARM='//CHECK(ON)'  or  PARM='//TERMTHDACT(DUMP)'
</pre></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Loader options</b></p>

<p><pre>
  MAP
  NOMAP  (default)

    - this option (MAP) produces a map of the load module that lists

  PRINT  (default)
  NOPRINT

    - this option (PRINT) produces diagnostic messages on the SYSLOUT
      data set


  LET
  NOLET  (default)

    - this option (MAP) produces a map of the load module control
      sections and entry points


  XREF
  NOXREF  (default)
