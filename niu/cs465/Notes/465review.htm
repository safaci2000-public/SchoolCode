<b>Part II. Short Answer</b>

Assume the following record description for PLAYER-FILE:

01  PLAYER-REC.
    05  PLAYER-NUMBER     PIC X(3).
    05  PLAYER-NAME       PIC X(30).
    05  PLAYER-RBIS       PIC 9(3).
    05  PLAYER-BAT-AVG    PIC 9V9(3)

11. Define a RRDS cluster that has a space allocation of 3 tracks primary
    and 3 tracks secondary, is located on ACA302, and has player number as
    its relative record number.










12. Write the DD statement(s) that will be needed by a COBOL program that
    uses the cluster defined in question 11.






13. Write a complete SELECT statement for PLAYER-FILE, which may be read
    from or written to, and may be processed sequentially or randomly.
    Define any extra storage that may be needed.










14. Write the code to open PlAYER-FILE.






15. Write the code to display all of the records in PLAYER-FILE.




















16. Write the code to display the record for player number 10.  If the
