<p><b>Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM)</b></p>

</font><font face="Courier New" size=3>

<p>VSAM is an access method that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>allows sequential access to files either by a key or by sequence</p></li>
<li><p>allows direct access by key, relative byte address, or by relative 
record number</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A VSAM file is known as a cluster</p>

<p>There are three types of clusters:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Entry Sequenced Data Set (ESDS)</li>
  <li>Relative Record Data Set (RRDS)</li>
  <li>Key Sequenced Data Set (KSDS)</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><font face="Courier New" size=4>
<p><b>Entry Sequenced Data Set (ESDS)</b></p>
</font><font face="Courier New" size=3>

<ul>
<li><p>allows for sequential access and organization only</p></li>
<li><p>records are accessed by their relative byte address</p></li>
<li><p>records are added at the end</p></li>
<li><p>may have fixed or variable length records</p></li>
<li><p>consists of only a data component</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><font face="Courier New" size=4>
<p><b>Relative Record Data Set (RRDS)</b></p>
</font><font face="Courier New" size=3>

<ul>
<li><p>allows both random and sequential access</p></li>
<li><p>records are accessed by a relative record number (hash number)</p></li>
<li><p>may have fixed length records only</p></li>
<li><p>consists of a data component only</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><font face="Courier New" size=4>
<p><b>Key Sequenced Data Set (KSDS)</b></p>
</font><font face="Courier New" size=3>

<ul>
<li><p>allows both random and sequential access</p></li>
<li><p>records are accessed by a unique key value (index)</p></li>
<li><p>may have fixed or variable length records</p></li>
<li><p>consists of a data and index component</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <b>data component</b> is made up of <b>data records</b>, which are
the actual records that are read into or written from a program.  The data
records are stored in ascending key sequence.</p>

<p>The data records are grouped into <b>control intervals</b>.  Each CI has a
fixed length, may contain records and free space, and has control information
stored at the bottom.</p>

<p>The control intervals are grouped into <b>control areas</b>.  The number
of control intervals per control area depends on how much space is reserved when
the data set is created.</p>

<p>The <b>index component</b> is made up of an <b>index set</b> and a <b>
sequence set</b>.</p>

<p>The index set lists the largest index within each control area.</p>

<p>The sequence set lists the largest index within each control interval.</p>

<p><b>Adding records to a cluster</b></p>
</font><font face="Courier New" size=3>

<p>When there is enough free space within a control interval to add a
new data record, the record is added in the position that will maintain
key sequence.</p>

<p>When there is an not enough free space within a control interval AND there is
an empty control interval within the same control area, a <b>control interval split</b>
will occur.  Records from the full control interval are moved to the empty one.</p>

<p>When there is an not enough free space within a control interval AND there is
not an empty control interval within the same control area, a <b>control area split</b>
will occur.  Space will be allocated for a new control area.  Records are moved to the new
control area.  A control interval split occurs in the old control area.</p>

<p><b>Accessing records in a cluster</b></p>
</font><font face="Courier New" size=3>

<p>Two types of pointers (<b>vertical</b> and <b>horizontal</b>) are used
to access records.  The vertical pointers are used for direct access by key.  The
horizontal pointers are used for sequential access.</p>

<p><b>Creating, maintaining, and deleting VSAM clusters</b></p>
</font><font face="Courier New" size=3>

<p>VSAM clusters are managed by a utility called IDCAMS.</p>

Depending on the operation being performed, other DD statements
might be included.


<b>control statements</b>:

 - must begin between columns 2 and 16
 - for continuation, use a hyphen as the last non-blank character
 - place comments between /* and */ that doesn't start in col 1
