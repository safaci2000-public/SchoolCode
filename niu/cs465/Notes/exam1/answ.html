  ansarray[0] = "Do not multiply primary allocation by 15."
  ansarray[1] = "Do not simply add the two allocations together."
  ansarray[2] = "I cannot follow your reasoning for this one."    
  ansarray[3] = "Right. 4 tracks for primary allocation once, plus 15 * 6 tracks secondary allocation."
  ansarray[4] = "Sorry, there is an answer."

  ansarray[5] = "This name is OK."
  ansarray[6] = "Right. The substring 'MYDATASET' exceeds the maximum 8 characters. "    
  ansarray[7] = "This name is OK."
  ansarray[8] = "Nope.  There's a problem with at least one of them."
  ansarray[9] = "You're partially correct."

  ansarray[10] = "Remember that conditions specify when NOT to execute a step."
  ansarray[11] = "The condition does not refer to the previous step."
  ansarray[12] = "Remember that conditions specify when NOT to execute a step."
  ansarray[13] = "Right. Remember, if the condition specified is TRUE, you are THROUGH. "    

  ansarray[14] = "Neither one is required if the data set is not used by subsequent steps."
  ansarray[15] = "DSN is not required if data set not used later."
  ansarray[16] = "Only two of these parameters is required."
  ansarray[17] = "Only two of these parameters is required."
  ansarray[18] = "Right. The only values required in this circumstance are SPACE and UNIT."    

  ansarray[19] = "Source code is input to the COMPILER."
  ansarray[20] = "Object modules are not executable."
  ansarray[21] = "There is no such thing as a non-executable load module."
  ansarray[22] = "This is part of the answer."
  ansarray[23] = "This is part of the answer."
  ansarray[24] = "Right. There is no such thing as an executable object module or non-executable load module. "    

  ansarray[25] = "The first block is moved before this occurs."
  ansarray[26] = "If the buffer is empty, a second or third block will be fetched."
  ansarray[27] = "Right. First block of records is moved when the file is opened. "    
  ansarray[28] = "No.  The program might not even do I/O each time."
  ansarray[29] = "Sorry, there is a correct answer."

  ansarray[30] = "Partially correct."
  ansarray[31] = "Partially correct."
  ansarray[32] = "The loader outputs a load module."
  ansarray[33] = "The linkage editor outputs a load module."
  ansarray[34] = "Right. The assembler and compiler both produce object modules as output. "    

  ansarray[35] = "The assembler does not create nor execute a load module."
  ansarray[36] = "The compiler does not create nor execute a load module."
  ansarray[37] = "Right. Only the loader executes the load module."
  ansarray[38] = "The Linkage editor makes a load module but does not execute it. "     
  ansarray[39] = "Half right."

  ansarray[40] = "The Assembler is normally associated with the 'ASM' step."
  ansarray[41] = "The compiler is normally associated with the 'COB' step."
  ansarray[42] = "Right. Only the Loader executes a program. That is the traditional 'GO' step. "    
  ansarray[43] = "The Linkage Editor is normally associated with the 'LKED' step."
  ansarray[44] = "Half right."

  ansarray[45] = "PARM= is not a required keyword parm.  Does not cause a JCL error."
  ansarray[46] = "Omitting PARM= would not cause a compiler error."
  ansarray[47] = "There is no such message produced by the Loader / Linkage Editor."
  ansarray[48] = "The program would execute, but possibly bomb if the omitted parm was crucial. "    
  ansarray[49] = "Right, but the program may not behave correctly."

  ansarray[50] = "Half Right. Cobol automatically provides for standard entry conditions."
  ansarray[51] = "You can receive the parameters without a DSECT."
  ansarray[52] = "Half right."
  ansarray[53] = "Sorry.  There is a correct answer."
  ansarray[54] = "Right. Both are true."

  ansarray[55] = "This will end the run unit."
  ansarray[56] = "Right. GOBACK causes a return to the program's caller. "    
  ansarray[57] = "This is used in the Cobol SORT feature."
  ansarray[58] = "Sorry, there is an answer."
  ansarray[59] = "Sorry, there is only one answer."

  ansarray[60] = "Right. The linkage section simply describes the structure of the incoming parms. "    
  ansarray[61] = "No because the linkage section is not a list of addresses."
  ansarray[62] = "This is true only of the main program's linkage section."
  ansarray[63] = "There is an answer."
  ansarray[64] = "Only one item is true."

  ansarray[65] = "Not even close."
  ansarray[66] = "Halfway there."
  ansarray[67] = "Right. Every PDS directory block is always 256 bytes long. "    
  ansarray[68] = "Reduce this by half and you're there."
  ansarray[69] = "Sorry, there is an answer."

  ansarray[70] = "This is the minimum, but some PDS members may be larger."
  ansarray[71] = "This is the size of a member's name."
  ansarray[72] = "This is the maximum, but some PDS members may be smaller."
  ansarray[73] = "No.  Member names are always 8 bytes long."
  ansarray[74] = "Right. Some members will be the minimum 12 bytes, others the maximum 74 bytes, others in between. "    

  ansarray[75] = "This usually represents printed output."
  ansarray[76] = "This handles messages from the loader."
  ansarray[77] = "Right. SYSLMOD is the output from the link editor, i.e., a permanent load module."    
  ansarray[78] = "This represents the object module input."
  ansarray[79] = "Sorry, there is an answer."

  ansarray[80] = "No.  Object modules are sequential files."
  ansarray[81] = "Right. Load modules must always be saved in a PDS. "    
  ansarray[82] = "May be saved as PDS member, but does not have to be."
  ansarray[83] = "I made this up.  I don't even know what it means."
  ansarray[84] = "Sorry, there is an answer."

  ansarray[85] = "It represents a displacement, but not this one."
  ansarray[86] = "Right. Indexes always hold displacements from the beginning of the table. "    
  ansarray[87] = "Never.  Although coded in this fashion, internally it is not stored like this."
  ansarray[88] = "How would this help find a particular slot?"
  ansarray[89] = "Sorry, there is an answer."

  ansarray[90] = "This tells the compiler you'll be using single quotes around literals."
  ansarray[91] = "Tells the compiler to do range checking."
  ansarray[92] = "Right. What more can I say?. "    
  ansarray[93] = "Tells the compiler what level of error messages to flag."
  ansarray[94] = "Sorry, there is an answer."

  ansarray[95] = "Half right."
  ansarray[96] = "Not the same as the PIC clause."
  ansarray[97] = "Size has nothing to do with the sign."
  ansarray[98] = "Since it's 01 level, we know it's double word aligned."
  ansarray[99] = "Right. Any binary item 10 - 18 digits in length takes up 8 bytes. "    

  ansarray[100] = "This improves numeric processing efficiency. "    
  ansarray[101] = "This is NOT required, but is a good suggestion."
  ansarray[102] = "Programmers generally declare subscripts as display items, thus too slow."
  ansarray[103] = "Indexes are compiler generated binary items. "    
  ansarray[104] = "If the data set is really a temp (begins with &&) it will not be saved. "    
  ansarray[105] = "If the data set is really a temp (begins with &&) it will not be saved. "    
  ansarray[106] = "The compiler will always reserve room for the maximum number of items. "    
  ansarray[107] = "With DEPENDING ON, you never know how many items there will be."
  ansarray[108] = "L stands for Locate.  M stands for Move."
  ansarray[109] = "If it is a Locate mode, then you must transfer the data. "    
  ansarray[110] = "What do you think is in SYSLIB?"
  ansarray[111] = "It can accept load modules, object modules, and text cards as input. "    
  ansarray[112] = "A called program does not necessarily have to return control. "    
  ansarray[113] = "A called program does not necessarily have to return control. "    
  ansarray[114] = "Location in memory depends on the Loader."
  ansarray[115] = "It merely determines where to start the location counter value."    
  ansarray[116] = "Group moves are always treated as alphanumeric."    
  ansarray[117] = "Group moves are always treated as alphanumeric."    
  ansarray[118] = "All existing data sets have a DSCB."    
  ansarray[119] = "If no DSCB, how is LRECL determined?"
