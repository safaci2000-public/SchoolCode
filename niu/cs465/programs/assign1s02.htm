<p>For this assignment you are to write a COBOL program that will produce weekly reports
as well as a final report for the BIG 9 Conference's annual Tiddily-Winks Tournament. Each
of the nine schools in the Big 9 conference has 4 teams that compete in the tournament.
Each team plays 3 games of tiddily-winks a week for 7 weeks, the life of the tournament.</p>

<p>A perfect score for one game of tiddily-winks is 100 points.&nbsp; Thus, for any given
week, no team can score more than 300 points, and no school can score more than 1200
points. At the end of the tournament, the team that accumulates the most points over 7
weeks wins $5000.000, and the school whose teams score the most points during the
tournament wins $20,000.00</p>

<p>Your program should produce a weekly report for each week of the tournament similar in
format to the Page 1 report of the Sample Report. Each weekly report must be on a separate
page. At the end of the 7 weeks, produce a final report on a separate page that is similar
to the sample final report.</p>

<p>The following data sets will be used by your program:</p>

<p>1. School names and team names are located in T90RAZ1.C465S02.NAMEFILE on ACA302.
Assign the file to NAME. Each record in this file has the following structure:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%">SCHOOL_NAME</td>
    <td width="16%"></td>
    <td width="69%">PIC X(20).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%">TEAM_NAME</td>
    <td width="16%">OCCURS 4 TIMES</td>
    <td width="69%">PIC X(20).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>2. Each week's tiddily-winks scores are located in T90RAZ1.C465S02.SCORFILE on ACA302.
Assign the file to SCORE. Each record in this file has the following structure:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="17%">WEEK_NUMBER</td>
    <td width="83%">PIC 9 COMP.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="17%">SCHOOL_NUMBER</td>
    <td width="83%">PIC 9 COMP.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="17%">WEEKLY_SCORES</td>
    <td width="83%">OCCURS 4 TIMES.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="17%"></td>
    <td width="83%"><table border="0" width="100%">
      <tr>
        <td width="15%">GAME_1</td>
        <td width="10%">PIC 999</td>
        <td width="75%">COMP.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="15%">GAME_2</td>
        <td width="10%">PIC 999</td>
        <td width="75%">COMP.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="15%">GAME_3</td>
        <td width="10%">PIC 999</td>
        <td width="75%">COMP.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </td>
  </tr>

<p><strong>Note that all of the numbers in this file are in BINARY format.</strong></p>

<p>Your output file should be assigned to PRINTER.<br>
<br>
Use the following JCL to compile and execute your program. <strong>Be very careful when
entering this JCL so that it resembles what you see below.</strong></p>

<p>PROGRAMMING NOTES:<br>
<br>
1. This assignment has been designed to use one, two, and three dimensional tables. Use a
three dimensional Working-Storage table to hold the scores for the three games played by
each team (1-4) and that team's total score for the week (your program will compute this
latter value), within school (1-9), within week number (1-7). </p>

<p>Use a two dimensional table to hold team name and team total score for seven weeks
within school name. Any additional tables you need to use are up to your own design.</p>

<p>2. Use only indexes to access individual table entries. You may not use subscripts.
Since you will be using multiple tables and multiple indexes, give the indexes meaningful
and descriptive names. This is a big aid when it comes to debugging time.<br>
<br>
3. The date in the report headings must be the date on which the report is generated. Use
COBOL's DATE facility to ACCEPT the date, and then use INSPECT..REPLACING to insert
slashes (/) between year/month/day.<br>
<br>
4. All internal numeric data fields that are used in your program, except those which will
eventually be printed in the report, must be declared as <strong>binary</strong> fields
whether or not they are part of a table. The numeric fields that will eventually be
printed in the report should be declared as <strong>packed</strong> <strong>decimal</strong>
fields.<br>
<br>
5. Use AUTHOR and DATE-COMPILED in the Identification Division of your program.</p>

<p><strong>PRINT/PUNCH UTILITY PROGRAM</strong><br>
<br>
The scores file used in this assignment is in binary format which is not printable. To
know if your program is producing correct output, it helps to have a copy of the input
data. There is a copy of the input data which is in display format (i.e., it's printable).
You can use the following JCL to obtain a printed copy of the display<br>
version of the scores file.<br>
