<p><strong>//CSCI 465<br>
//PROGRAM 2<br>
//50 POINTS<br>
/*JCL</strong><br>
<br>
This assignment consists of three separate jobs.&nbsp; All three jobs must be run as <strong>separate
jobs</strong>. JCL must be properly documented in all parts. Turn in all three jobs when
the assignment is due.&nbsp; <strong><font color="#FF0000">USE A BLACK CLIP TO CLIP ALL 3
PROGRAMS TOGETHER</font>.</strong><br>
<br>
JOB I - 20 points<br>
<br>
Compile and execute your assignment 1 COBOL program using the Loader (i.e., HEWLDRGO). Use
NOSOURCE, APOST, and FLAG(W,W) as Compiler options and the MAP Loader option. Do not allow
the Loader to execute if the return code from the Compiler is greater than zero.<br>
<br>
JOB II - 20 points<br>
<br>
Compile your assignment 1 source code using the same Compiler options as above, then use
the Linkage Editor (HEWL) with the MAP option to create a load module stored in a
permanent PDS on your own MVS account. The Link Editor step should not execute if the
Compile step return code is not zero. If the Linkage Editor step terminates abnormally,
you will have to delete the PDS before you can rerun this part. Read about the IEFBR14
utility in your class notes (pp. 117 - 118) which you can use to delete a PDS.&nbsp; See
further discussion of this below.<br>
<br>
JOB III - 10 points<br>
<br>
Execute the load module created by the Linkage Editor in part II. On your final run, the
one you turn in to be graded, add a job step (or two) to execute IEFBR14 to (uncatalog)
and/or delete your PDS.&nbsp; Again, see further discussion below.</p>

<p><big>Permanent Data Sets</big></p>

<p>When you create a permanent data set here at NIU, you have to specify whether or not to
catalog it.&nbsp; If you do not catalog a data set, then it will be removed from the
volume on which it was saved by the next day.&nbsp; This is important to know.&nbsp; If,
for example, you ran job II above on a Tuesday and created a permanent library with your
load module in it that was not catalogued, then if you came in to run job III on
Wednesday, the library (and your load module) will not be there. You would have to first
rerun job II.&nbsp; If you ran job III on Tuesday (the same day as the day you created the
library), then everything would be fine.</p>

<p>To get a data set to stay permanently on a volume, you must specify that it is to be
catalogued when you create it. If a data set is catalogued, then in order to successfully
delete it, you must run IEFBR14 TWICE.&nbsp; The first time you indicate that the data set
should be uncatalogued.&nbsp; The second time you indicate that it should be deleted.</p>

<p>What does all of this mean?&nbsp; Well, it means that when you run job II, if your PDS
gets <strong>catalogued</strong> and your job abends, then before you can rerun part II
you must first execute IEFBR14 <strong>twice</strong>...once to uncatalog it and once to
delete it.&nbsp; If you run job II and <strong>DO NOT</strong> catalog your PDS, then you
would only have to execute IEFBR14 once (just to delete the library) before you could run
job II a second time on the same day.</p>

<p>Likewise for job III.&nbsp; On your grade run you are to delete the PDS that contains
your load module.&nbsp; If the PDS was catalogued, then you need to execute IEFBR14
twice...once to uncatalog and once to delete.&nbsp; If the PDS was not catalogued, then
you only need to execute IEFBR14 once, just to delete the library.</p>
