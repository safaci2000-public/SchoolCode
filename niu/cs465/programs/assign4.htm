Write the JCL to compile and execute (using the Loader) a Cobol source program that is
named T90RAZ1.ASS4CODE. The source program uses the input data set named T90RAZ1.ASS4DATA
with the DD card name of MYINPUT. Both data sets are on ACA301. The source program writes
its output to the printer with DD card name MYOUTPUT.<br>
<br>
The source program will abend when it is executed. You may use any compiler or run-time
options that you want to enable you to debug the program and to answer the questions that
appear below.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">You may only run one job</font>, but you can use
whatever compiler or run time options you want.<br>
<br>
On your JOB printout, LOCATE, LABEL, and HIGHLIGHT the information (file, instruction, DCB
information, etc.) that you use to answer the questions.<br>
<br>
You are to work ALONE on this assignment. Your answers must be complete and must be NEATLY
written (preferably typed) on 8 1/2 by 11 paper. Illegible answers will not be given any
credit.<br>
<br>
1.) (4) What is the entry point of the Cobol program? List at least two places where this
information can be found.<br>
<br>
2.) (4) What is the absolute address of the next instruction that would have executed had
the program not abended? Where did you find this information?<br>
<br>
3.) (4) What is the absolute address of the instruction that caused the abend? How did you
find this information? Show any<br>
calculations. <br>
<br>
4.) (4) What is the relative address of the next instruction that would have executed had
the program not abended? Show your<br>
calculations.<br>
<br>
5.) (4) What is the relative address of the instruction that caused the abend? Show your
calculations.<br>
<br>
6.) (4) What kind of abend occurred in the program? Where did you find this information?<br>
<br>
7.) (4) What is the line number and Cobol statement that corresponds to the abending
instruction? Show at least 2 different<br>
ways that you could find out this information.<br>
<br>
8.) (4) What are the contents (in hex) of the operands of the abending COBOL STATEMENT.
How did you find this information?<br>
<br>
9.) (5) Write the machine instruction that caused the abend. Using the &quot;yellow
card&quot; machine instruction formats, identify the op code, length, base, and
displacements components. Decode the machine instruction into an assembler instruction.<br>
<br>
10.) (5) Correct the Cobol source code so the abend can be avoided in future runs. Write
your correction(s) on the compiler produced source code. Do not change anything in the
Working-Storage section.<br>
<br>
11.) (4) What access method is used for the input file? How and where did you find this
information?<br>
<br>
12.) (4) What are the contents of FIELD-3 at the time of abend? Show at least 2 ways to
find this information.<br>
