<pre>                        Extra Credit Assignment</pre>

<pre>                         Utilities - 40 Points</pre>

<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>

<pre>     Create and run a multistep job using the utility programs to per-
form the operations described below.  Use proper JCL documentation.</pre>

<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>

<pre>Input:</pre>

<pre>     Four input files are involved here, all catalogued.  </pre>

<pre>     The first 9 steps involve two files. The OLDUSER file has data set
name T90HCH1.CSCI465.SPRING02.EXTRA.OLDUSER, and the NEWUSER file has
data set name T90HCH1.CSCI465.SPRING02.EXTRA.NEWUSER.</pre>

<pre>     The next 6 steps involve the PDSDATA file which has data set name
T90HCH1.CSCI465.SPRING02.EXTRA.DATA.  You will also need a PDS called
T90HCH1.CSCI465.SPRING02.EXTRA.LIB. </pre>

<pre>     The records in the OLDUSER file have this format:</pre>

<pre>          Field               Columns      Type of Data</pre>

<pre>          Last Name             1-10        alphabetic
          First Name           11-20        alphabetic
          ID                   21-29        numeric
          LogonID              30-36        alphanumeric
          Password             37-44        alphanumeric
          Account Balance      45-50        signed numeric, 
                                            dollars and cents
          Credit Rating        51           signed numeric</pre>

<pre>     The records in the NEWUSER file have this format:</pre>

<pre>          Field                Columns       Type of Data</pre>

<pre>          ID                     1-9          numeric
          LogonID               10-14         alphanumeric
          Last Name             15-24         alphabetic
          First Name            25-34         alphabetic</pre>

<pre>     The records in the PDSDATA file are each 43 bytes long.  They are
in 3 groups.  The first group is terminated by a record with !!!!! in
the columns 6 through 10, and the second group is terminated by a record
with ???????? in the last 8 bytes.</pre>

<pre>     The records in the various members of the PDS also have a record
length of 43.
</pre>

<pre>Processing:</pre>

<pre>     Your job should contain the following steps:</pre>

<pre> 1.  Use IEBPTPCH to print the OLDUSER file using IEBPTPCH's default
     format (no RECORD FIELD).  You should have a page heading, and
     it should be single-spaced.
 </pre>

<pre> 2.  Use IEBGENER to copy the OLDUSER file and rearrange the fields in
     this order:</pre>

<pre>         LogonID
         First Name
         Last Name
         Password
         ID
         Credit Rating
         Account Balance</pre>

<pre>     Give the new file a name of the form Znumber.OLDCOPY, where Znumber 
     is your own LogonID.   </pre>

<pre> 3.  Use IEBGENER to copy the NEWUSER file.  You will need to make the
     record longer to make the format match the records in the OLDUSER 
     file:
     (a)  The existing LogonID is 5 characters long, and it should be 
          7, so add the user's initials (first initial, last initial, 
          in that order, at the beginning of the old LogonID to form 
          the new one.  That is, if the user's name is Kathy Jones and 
          her LogonID (in the NEWUSER) file is 12345, then we want to 
          make her LogonID (in the new version of the file) KJ12345.
     (b)  The Password should be 'LETMEIN!'.
     (c)  The Account Balance should be 0.
     (d)  The Credit Rating should be 0.</pre>

<pre>     The order of fields in the new file should match the order of
     fields in the new copy of OLDUSER.</pre>

<pre>     Give the new file a name of the form Znumber.NEWCOPY, where Znumber
     is your own LogonID.  </pre>

<pre> 4.  Use SYNCSORT to sort the two new files, OLDCOPY from step 2 and 
     NEWCOPY from step 3, concatenated together in SORTIN, in ascending 
     order on the LogonID field, into a temporary file.</pre>

<pre> 5.  Use IEBGENER to make a copy of the temporary file from step 4.  Pack 
     all the numeric fields.  The new copy should have a name of the form      
     Znumber.PACKED.   </pre>

<pre> 6.  Use IEBPTPCH to print the PACKED file (from step 5) in hexadecimal 
     format, single-spaced.  Use a page heading but there is no need for  
     column headings or separation between fields.</pre>

<pre> 7.  Use IEBPTPCH to print the PACKED file into a temporary file, unpack-
     ing all the packed numeric fields.  </pre>

<pre>&nbsp;
 8.  Use IEBGENER to copy the temporary file from step 7 into a new
     file.  Remove the carriage-control character in column 1.  Insert a
     dollar sign at the left of the Account Balance field and a decimal
     point between the dollars and cents.  Remove the sign digit from the
     end of the ID field.  Insert dashes into the ID field so the numbers
     are in the format 999-99-9999.  The new copy should be named
     Znumber.NEATCOPY.</pre>

<pre> 9.  Use IEBPTPCH to print NEATCOPY, the file created in step 8.  You
     should provide a page heading and column headings.  Leave at least
     5 spaces between columns.  Make it single-spaced.  You may need to
     use STRTAFT=1.  (Figure out why!)</pre>

<pre>10.  Use IEBGENER to create 3 members of a new PDS from the PDSDATA 
     file.  Call the 3 members FIRST, SECOND and THIRD, in that order.
     Invent a name for your PDS, starting with your Znumber.</pre>

<pre>11.  Use IEBPTPCH to print all of the members of your PDS.  Use a page 
     heading and single-spacing but no editing. </pre>

<pre>12.  Use IEHLIST to print the directory of your PDS.</pre>

<pre>13.  Use IEBCOPY to copy the members NEWFIRST, SECOND and FOURTH from 
     the PDS named T90HCH1.CSCI465.SPRING02.EXTRA.LIB into the PDS 
     you created in step 8.  When you copy NEWFIRST, change its name 
     to FIRST, replacing the original FIRST member.  When you copy
     SECOND, make sure it replaces the original SECOND.</pre>

<pre>14.  Use IEHLIST to print the directory of your PDS.</pre>

<pre>15.  Use IEBPTPCH with TYPORG=PO to print all 4 members of your PDS.  
     (You do not need any MEMBER statements.)  Use a page heading and 
     single-spacing but no editing. </pre>

<pre>16.  Use IEFBR14 to delete all these files and libraries you have been
     creating in the above steps.</pre>

<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>

<pre>Notes:</pre>

<pre>     You need to choose a VOL=SER for each permanent file or PDS, either 
ACA301 or ACA302.</pre>

<pre>     When you create the new files using IEBGENER, you will need to
supply DCB information on the DD statements.</pre>

<pre>     Put appropriate COND parameters on the steps that need them.  Use 
COND=EVEN on the last step.</pre>

<pre>     Please don't do any extra steps.  This is long enough as it is.
Along the way, though, it may be necessary to run some extra IEFBR14
jobs to delete files from time to time.</pre>
