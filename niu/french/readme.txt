For a French class i was taking, I decided to do a presentation on some basic C++ programming.

hence the .pdf is a nice french tutorial on how to code in C++.

and the test.cc is a basic program i've written to demonstrate how a program works... though for a rudimentary presentation it went above and beyond the poor frenchies heads...
