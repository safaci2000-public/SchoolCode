  Intro to Trees and Graphs.

  type of trees.  Organization Char, expression Tree
               +				(inorder)
		*              5
	3        2

  there is an edge between parent and child denoted as (u,v)  u=parent, v=child

  internal node  === !leaf

  nodes of same level are siblings

  binary = tree with only 2 branches per node.
     full tree has 2^(h-1) = # nof nodes in a full bin. tree (h= heigh of tree)
     minimum height of bin tree is log(n+1);

	Trees:  
		traversal:  pre-order, inorder, postorder, level traversal

		time complexity of level traversal O(n);

		general tree Imp.

		class treeNode										
		{
		  Object element
		  TreeNode *firstChild
		  TreeNode *nextsibling
		}
	Graphs:        *yuppie*

	   consists of V nodes (vertices )  { nodes == vertices }
	   and E of edges:  each ede connects two nodes

	   each node is an item
	   each edge represents a relationship between 2 items

		no root

		v = { 1, 2, 3, 5}
		e = { (1,2), (1,3), (3,5), (5,2)}

		2 nodes u and are are said to be adjacent if (u,v) is a member of e
		path:  nodes to go through to get from node x to node y.
