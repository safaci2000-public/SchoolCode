 Estimate available funds for the week
 1. compute estimate returns on the investment for the week
 2. computer estimate operating exp. for the week
 3. compute the estimated mortgate payments for the week
 4. computer the estimated grants given for week
 5. available funds for the week = (1) - (2) +(3) - (4)
 6. print the avail. funds report

Print Report:
 1.  On demand print the investments report

 for each investment print the defaults of the invest.
 1. item number
 2. name
 3. estimated annual return
 4. date is computed

Investments:

  item number,
  item name,
  estimated annual 
  	return (updated whenever new information comes )
  date estimate annual return was updated.


For each mortage keep the following info:
  acct #
  name of borrowers 
  orginal purchase price
  date mortgage was issued
  weekly P&I
  current confirmed gross weekly income
  date the above was updated
  annual real-estate tax
  date it was updated
  annual home owners insurance preimum
  date it was updated

  Programming Languages for Large Scale Parallel Computing

  Very large system >> 1k cpu cores

  Focused on Scientific Computing

  	memory races are bugs, not features.
	programmers expect reproducibility
  Large codes
      >> 100 KLOC

	Mirianet.  

	shared memory prog:  Open np

	C++, Fortran (computationation kernels), MPI (Inter process communication)

	MPI Language:
	   Performance  -- 
	      faster, compiled communication that avoid software overhead of mpi
		  compiler optimization of communication
	   Performacne:  Fortran more dominant then C/C++ in MPI
    Ideal Language:
		  faster, compiled communication that avoid software overhead of MPI
		  Compiler optimization of communications
		  Time = work/p + depth

  Three types of classes:
  	Entity Class   -- long lasting info       O

	Bounding class	-- user interface, reports etc.   |-O
	control class	-- non-trivial algo


	estimite avail. weekly funds
	manage an investment
	manae a mortage
	update estimated operating expanse
	provide a report

    
	Manage a mortage -- a scenarion where real estate tax is updated


	1. staff member
		counts the mortgage identity,
		the new vaule of real estate tax
	2. The system find the mortgage & updates the tax

	Alter.
		Athe requested mortage is not present mortage # extneded.

	1.  staff enters the mortage # & the new value of the new value of weekly gross income
	2.  the system updates the weekly gross income and it also updates the date-weekly-income test updated
	alter:

	A.  mortage # wrongly entered
	B. proper documentation not presented

  Second for "estimated funds available for week" 

  1.  for each investment of the estimated anual return.
     sum them up and divide by 52
  2.  obtain annual operate expense and divde by 52
  3.  for each mortage
      3.1 computer P&I + 1/52(re tax + ins premium)
	  3.2 computer 28% of weekly income
	  3.3 if 3.1 > 3.2 then
	        3.2 is the weekly payment
			3.1 - 3.2 is the grant
		  else 
		     3.1 is the weekly payment and grant=0 
  4.  add mortage  payment computed in 3
  5.  compute the \cdots 


  Initial class Diagram:

    basic desc of the software:

		 Weekly reports are to be printed showing how much money is available for mortages.  In addition , history of investmens and mortages must be printed on demand

  Cohesion:

     1. Coincidental Cohesion   -- module has coincidental cohesion.
	 		It performs many unrelated operations  (get next message, read a file, something else)
	2. Logical Cohesion
		module performs a series of operations one of which is chosen through the arguments and the code for the different operations may be interlaced.
	3.  Temporal Cohesion
			Performs a set of operations temporarily related 
			can not be used
	4.  Procedural Cohesion
			performs a series of operations by a sequence of steps followed by a product.
	5.  Communication Cohesion
			All the operations are one the same data.
	6.  Functional Cohesion
	 		module performs exactly one operations.  Debug easily, reusable
	7.  Information cohesion
			perform a series of operation on the same data
			each with its own entry and exit points (abstract)

Coupling:
	
	1.  Content coupling
			two modules are content
			couples if one directly
			direct reference the contents of the other module
			module a modified a statement in module b
