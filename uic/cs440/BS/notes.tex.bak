MSG foundation:

performs calculations need to determine how much money is available each to purchase a home.

msg staff member ==> |estimates funds for the week. |
applicant   ==>      | apply for msg mortage        |  
staff member	     | compute weekly repay amount  |
staff member	     | manageing investments	    |


Requi:
   couples married for at least one year and at most for ten years.
   both of them are employed
   28% of the weekly gorss income of the couples < weekly payments for the mortgage
                 or
   the couples can not pay the initial deposit + closing costs ($7000)

  
  1 estimate annual return on the investments and divide by 52
  2 estimate operating expenses for the year and divide by 52
  3 total estimated mortgage paymetns for the week is completed
  4 Total estimated grant amount is computed

  funds available for the week (1) - (2) + (3) - (4)

  Estimate funds available for the week

  Estimate investment's return for the week

 MSG Cont.
(
 estimate funds for week
 manage investments
 update operating expenses
 manage mortgage    -- borrower
 print reports


 Estimate available funds for the week
 1. compute estimate returns on the investment for the week
 2. computer estimate operating exp. for the week
 3. compute the estimated mortgate payments for the week
 4. computer the estimated grants given for week
 5. available funds for the week = (1) - (2) +(3) - (4)
 6. print the avail. funds report

Print Report:
 1.  On demand print the investments report

 for each investment print the defaults of the invest.
 1. item number
 2. name
 3. estimated annual return
 4. date is computed

Investments:

  item number,
  item name,
  estimated annual 
  	return (updated whenever new information comes )
  date estimate annual return was updated.


For each mortage keep the following info:
  acct #
  name of borrowers 
  orginal purchase price
  date mortgage was issued
  weekly P&I
  current confirmed gross weekly income
  date the above was updated
  annual real-estate tax
  date it was updated
  annual home owners insurance preimum
  date it was updated
)

Rapid Prototype:

lots of user user interface and reports

Analysis:
   case tools, UML
